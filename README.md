# Sphinx Astrology

An astrology app targeting the Android platform.


## About

This program was originally designed as a full program for Windows
in around 2005-2006, and later rewritten as cross platform with wxWidgets,
and again rewritten for GTK+ until abandoned. The first version
was named *Horus Eye Astrology*, then the Linux version got the name
*Mantichora Tools*, and was part of a web page project with the domain
"mantichora.net". The project was never completely abandoned, but
rather "put on the shelf for later". The appearance of the Android
platform made the project come alive again.

The program code is based on the *Astronomical Almanac*, and
planetary calculations are quite precise and fast. All astronomical
and astrological calculations are in C code, using the JNI bridge.
Java and Android performs the graphical display and UI.

The planned functionality of Sphinx Astrology is to make it user
contribute based, the same as Wikipedia and Stack Exchange. All
users will be able to write their interpretations of astrological
symbolism, and then rate and comment each other. Accounts, profiles
and interpretations are stored on a server, and available through
a REST API.

The tool will be completely free to use except for a small one time
fee. There will be no additional or hidden fees or premium content,
or more expensive versions.

In *Mantichora Tools* there was also functionality for Tarot and
Qabalah. These functions are planned to be placed in separate
apps as part of a suit; there will be a Sphinx Tarot, and Sphinx
Qabalah.
