Where the Sun is weak, there is danger of short life or one broken by spells of illness or much misfortune.\n\nIt cannot be too strongly emphasized that an analysis of the meaning of every factor in Astrology is dependent upon its relation to every other factor.

Thus, it is from the sum of the forces and not from each one of them separately judged, that an analysis is made.\n\nThe reader should remember, therefore, that to read the analysis of the Sun in the signs as it follows, as an analysis verbatim of the solar position in a nativity, to read it except as one of the forces of a nativity to be united, accentuated or modified by the other factors involved, is not scientific astrology and will not give a true interpretation.

Mercury is, as we know, the mind; and while the contents of the mind are determined by the food of the mind, yet different minds deal quite differently with identical foods. It has been said that thousands of people before Newton saw apples fall from trees, but their only impulse was to eat them.\n\nThe proper and best influence upon Mercury is Saturn, and without his steadying hand to hold him in tutorship to a profounder wisdom, Mercury may be frivolous and vain.

But Venus is the handmaiden of the Sun and she is consequently attached to the vital force, even as Jupiter is more closely an emanation of Neptune, the other extreme of the system, the Soul. The altruism of Venus, therefore, means love in a quite conventional and often selfish or personal sense; her expansiveness is often mere amiability, possibly assumed in order to gain some end associated with the instinct of self-preservation; and, finally, Venus is altogether more material and, so to speak, fleshy, than Jupiter. Venus in any sign has so much connotation or reference that it is very necessary to take into consideration not only the sign in which it is placed, but also its aspects to other planets before judging of its effects. But the importance of the impact of the different signs is very great. In fact, the more material a planet is, the more easily it is influenced. We see no such violent commotion in the vaster planets; Uranus in Aries is not so different from Uranus in Libra, but Venus in Gemini is utterly different from Venus in Scorpio.\n\nIn dealing with Venus on the lines hitherto followed with the other planets, we are confronted with a difficulty peculiar to the nature of her own influence. It is easy to observe most of the effects of other planets in the life, character, and work of great men, but we know little of the inner details of their domestic and intimate relations.\n\nAlexander the Great may have beaten his wife, and Cromwell may have been a very clever and tactful father, but in the majority of those examples which have hitherto served us so well, we know little or nothing of the private life.

It might even occur that the whole of the higher faculties might be harmonious and strong, yet fail to make good, owing to the lack of practical energy, boldness, and capacity for rather brutal work. The material plane continually presents obstacles to the higher nature; Mars is the force which pushes such obstacles aside, or demolishes them.\n\nHis external influence upon the man as distinguished from his internal influence within the character, is that of excitement, inflammation, violence, and accident. Thus a square of Mars to the Sun might give a rugged constitution and dauntless energy, and at the same time subject the native to fevers and accidents from fire or steel.\n\nThe power of Mars will, of course, as before, be modified by his position in the Zodiac, and, owing to his material and therefore easily-molded nature, the variations will be, on the whole, more extreme than we have found to be the case with planets of greater spirituality.\n\nYet so great is his importance, that a badly afflicted Mars practically inhibits the native from making wise use of his enormous energy.

In religious symbolism Saturn is Jehovah&mdash;&ldquo;I am that I am&rdquo;&mdash;which is only a theocratic way of saying &ldquo;everything for myself.&rdquo; Jupiter is the divine Son, Jesus&mdash;the benevolently spendthrift heir&mdash;who gives his very life for others. Jupiter is the instinct of creation, of generosity and hospitality, and of the religious emotions generally; and, of course, in so far as the man is passive to Jupiter, he represents these qualities in the cosmos bestowed upon the man, and hence &ldquo;Good fortune.&rdquo; Naturally, his action depends, with regard to its scope, upon Neptune and Uranus. Unless these planets, signifying respectively the soul and the divine will, indicate bigness in the career, a good Jupiter will be no more than a luck-bringer in business or profession, and make the character noble, generous, and easy-going; and a weak Jupiter will only defeat advancement in life, and tend to enfeeble the character by making it spendthrift, luxurious, and unable to resist the influence of others.\n\nWe have intimated above through what channels Jupiter comes to express his creative and generous tendencies in material prosperity; but another point which should be emphasized in this regard is that Jupiter represents to a very great extent the ambition of the native. The force, quality, and degree of success of this ambition will be indicated by the strength and position of the planet, and the direction or channel through which this ambition may work out its best prosperity will be shown by the sign which Jupiter occupies, modified of course by other contributory conditions.\n\nIn the days when a man was either a lord or a serf, a knight or an innkeeper, it was comparatively easy to determine with exactness a man&apos;s vocation. In modern days, however, there are thousands of different and characteristic types of employment. While Jupiter is the key to the type of work which may bring a man money or profit, it does not necessarily follow that it is the kind of vocation for which he has the greatest inclination. Too often, indeed, his inclination is not that for which he is best adapted, or it is incompatible with his environment and education. On the other hand, an accurate observer may often see a person with distinct abilities for a certain type of work, and yet he recognizes that, for some other reason, he had an inability to make a success of that work.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Responsible Saturn acts to protect the interests of self, family, society, and the world from harm. Where Jupiter boldly seeks and grows with experience, Saturn has the wisdom of having learned from experience. But the wisdom and knowledge of Saturn relate to the material world, to the world of conditions, consequences, and rules. Saturn can be ambitious, controlling, and egoistic. Saturn protects the self against hurt by judging according to lower-mind polarities, such as smart versus stupid or winner versus loser. The function of the outer planets, which represent the higher mind, is to rebel against the limitations of the lower mind, providing opportunities for freedom from the tyranny of the everyday world&apos;s rules, conditions, polarities, and judgments.\n\nMan may be master of life and of death&mdash;if he will. To the worker in the fields of the intelligence, the farmer of mind, the harvest grows continually. Saturn is once again the golden god. The brain of the brain worker improves constantly until the age of sixty, and even then retains its vigor until the end. Such old men we often see. Instead of the vices and infirmities of age, they have consolidated virtues, conserved strength. Dignity and austerity crown and cloak them. They are simple, strenuous and lofty-minded. Even if they are of solitary habit, they are kind. The purpose of their lives has crystallized; and, because they have desired only the infinite, satiety does not touch them. Life is to them a religion of which they are the priests, an eternal sacrament of which perhaps the ecstasy is dulled, but which they consume with ever-increasing reverence. Joy and sorrow have been balanced, and the tale thereof is holy calm. They know that peace of God which passeth all understanding.\n\nThe commoner aspect of Saturn, however, is this: the malicious oldster, envious of youth, hating life because he has failed to live it according to the law of righteousness. His will-power is merely obstinacy, opposition to reform, failure to accommodate himself to changed conditions, the conservatism of the hardened brain. He feels his waning powers and tries to receive&mdash;to receive, when all his sensibility is gone! Feeling himself impotent, he vents his toothless rage upon the young. Unhappy himself, he seeks to make others wretched. Sordid and heartless, he sneers at enthusiasm and generosity.

Through the harmonious vibrations of Uranus, it is found that people become prophetic, keen, perceptive, executive, inventive, original, given to roaming, untrammeled by tradition, impatient of creeds, opinionated, argumentative, stubborn, and eccentric. They speak to the point; asserting, with startling confidence, opinions far in advance of their fellows. They come into possession of wealth in unexpected and strange ways, yet often appear to pass under the yoke of discipline as though cast down for a purpose from opulence to poverty, only to rise again by the unfolding of unexpected resources. Always ahead of their time, the natives of Uranus are often dreamers in philanthropy; poetic, though their writings need interpretation and are often unintelligible even to the imaginative, because of their mystical origin and transcendental coloring.\n\nIn the few years during which Uranus has been under observation, it has been found that, if afflicted, it is the source of incurable organic diseases, collapse of fortune, and individual as well as national destruction. It is demonstrable that, in inharmonious nativities, evil Uranian influences, both through transits and directions, have brought about headlong destruction from bad habits, misdirected affection, illicit connections before or after legal marriage; according to the signification of the place of radical affliction in the horoscope.\n\nEvery psychic thus far studied by the writer has been found, by careful consideration of the authentic birth data, to be under powerful Uranian influence; and to this vibration may be attributed clairvoyance, warning dreams, second-sight, clairaudience and similar phenomena.\n\nThe occupations or avocations which seem in sympathy with this strange planet are progressive, inventive, exploring, and of a humanitarian nature. The influence of Uranus is the least personal, and the most universal in the Zodiac; consequently, any endeavor for the betterment of humanity is favored by those who are strongly responsive to its vibration.\n\nUranus produces lecturers, public figures, travelers, inventors, aviators, radio operators, astrologers, electricians, scientists, physiologists, mesmerists, metaphysicians.\n\nUranus makes one impulsive and extremely eccentric; the native does not know his own mind, but is continually moved by providential agencies; he often becomes a fatalist, feeling that his destiny is beyond his own control.\n\nUranus emphasizes the will, causing the native to move spontaneously from an inner urge; the native is active, original, inventive, and is notable for his love of liberty and an idealistic sense of justice. The planet bestows leadership and causes the native to become a pioneer and to establish new orders of things.\n\nUranus makes the mind independent, original, and not amenable to control. The native is unconventional, altruistic and subject to sudden changes of attitude. There is an uncanny ability to sense motives.\n\nCircumstances induced by Uranus are sudden changes, estrangements, exiles, blind impulses, catastrophes, suicides, romantic tragedies, inexplicable changes of fortune, accidents, secret enemies, plottings, and sudden elevations.\n\nEvery living soul is presumed to have a purpose, and that purpose single. Not one in a million, perhaps, is conscious of that purpose; we seem for the most part to be a mass of vacillations. Even the main objective career of an individual cannot be considered as necessarily an expression of the interior will.\n\nBut Uranus indicates divine will; and the reason why he is so explosive and violent and upsetting to human affairs is that he represents the real intention, which, lying deeper than the conscious purpose, often contradicts it. The outer and the inner are then in conflict; and whenever battle is joined, the inner must win. To the outer consciousness, this naturally appears as disaster; for the native does not recognize the force as part of himself, or, if so, he regards it as a disturbing entity, and resents its dominion. Uranus is, in Egyptian symbolism, the Royal Uraeus Serpent; slow, yet sudden, Lord of life and death. It takes a great deal to move him; but, when once in motion, he is irresistible. This is why, to the normal mind, he appears so terrible.\n\nAs has been seen, the deep-lying interior purpose of any being is nearly always obscure and undecipherable to the mortal eye; but there is an indication or hieroglyph of it which is usually very significant. One can hardly call it more than the artistic expression of the purpose, and this appears a very good way to describe it. We call it the Temperament. It does not define the Will itself, but it sets limits to the sphere wherein the Will may work.\n\nWe have already found that the personality is imaged in the sign on the Ascendant; and from this we now turn to a consideration of the sign in which Uranus may be situated. Where these two factors are harmonious, we get a character with unity of moral purpose; where otherwise, a self-tortured waverer. It might be cited as an objection that those who have Uranus in the Ascendant are usually eccentric characters; but the argument is on the other side. Such eccentricity is temperament in its highest development; it shows the entire over-ruling of the superficial qualities by this deep-seated, turbulent, magical will. It is only to others that the person with Uranus rising appears so eccentric.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

The materialistic astrologer classes Neptune &ldquo;malefic, sinister, obscure,&rdquo; but the enlightened astrologian thoroughly understands that Neptune causes upon this earth and upon its natives the influx of a spiritual element unrelated to strictly earthly affairs. While the other planets are commensurable and deal with the relative, Neptune is incommensurable; he intrudes the absolute. In other words, for those developed spiritually Neptune is wholly &ldquo;good,&rdquo; for others he seems wholly &ldquo;bad.&rdquo; Neptune stirs the soul to aspiration toward the infinite; the result is that a humanitarian influence is projected by the native for the benefit of humanity&apos;s advance as a whole. On the other hand, for those whose desires cause them to plunge and wallow in the troughs of mere material delights and satisfactions, the Neptune influence is as a lightning bolt that shatters their temples of materialism to the very foundations.\n\nNeptune&apos;s orbit, being the outer circle of our known universe, is so vast, the effect of his movement upon the earth is so slow, that we may best consider his influence as negative upon our physical life, and as positive upon our spiritual impulses. He is as an indication of the tendency of the period, the planet of the new era, a barometer of the latter-day Universe.\n\nNeptune requires approximately fourteen years to move through a single sign. To give an account of his effects upon humanity would be to write the history of the world.\n\nOne can gauge him, to some extent, by considering certain events of comparatively recent times. Matters requiring wisdom are usually directed by men of between forty-five and fifty-five years, and the consensus of their influence may be divined from the place of Neptune at their birth.\n\nThus the Revolution of 1848 was brought about by men influenced by Neptune in Libra; they struggled for freedom and justice, but their policy lacked virility, while their methods failed because of indirectness. Similarly, the French Revolution was begun by people influenced by Neptune in Leo, but the generations of preparation toward that event involved people with that planet in Cancer or Gemini. Cromwell&apos;s Neptune was also in Leo.\n\nThe recent Great War was doubtless due to the influence of people born with Neptune in Aries; while the rebuilding of civilization has fallen upon those laborious and initiative men and women for whom Neptune works through Taurus and Gemini.\n\nThe scientific advance of the Nineteenth Century was due to pioneers stimulated by Neptune in Capricorn; and the fruits of their labors were gathered by men born with Neptune in Aquarius. Neptune was in Pisces, influencing the artistic, psychic decadent generation of the Nineties.\n\nTimes when skeptical thought attacks tradition by purely intellectual methods and makes constructive work possible are those influenced by Neptune in Gemini. Immanuel Kant, who destroyed the old philosophy, Voltaire, who destroyed the old religion, and their contemporaries were of such a generation.\n\nNeptune, being the planet of spiritual forces, is always revolutionary. Forever he quickens the old life and increases the new life; the principle is the same; only the material varies according to the signs through which he moves.\n\nBecause of the character of Neptune and the long period of time it requires to pass through a single sign, its influence upon the individual is very dependent upon its position and aspect to other planets. It is, therefore, obviously unnecessary to go into a lengthy account of its effect upon the individual in the twelve signs.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Aries, however, is under Mars as ruler, and this tends to bring out the arrows from the quiver of Apollo. In this sign, the Sun is sometimes apt to slay. Aries rules the head in man, and being also the beginning of the Zodiac, he tends to fill the mind of the native with extreme ambition to accomplish daringly original, yet practical undertakings. Wilhelm I of Germany, and Bismarck, who built the German Empire from the ruins of the struggles of the Middle Ages and of the Napoleonic Wars, both had the Sun in this sign. So had Thiers, who restored the French Republic after defeat by Prussia in the battle of Sedan and the flames of the Commune, and Gambetta who contributed so largely to the same work. It is frequently the case that the ideas of the native are considered impractical or impossible by those to whom he communicates them. It was fortunate for Bismarck that his King possessed the same Sun position, for it is characteristic of these people that, unless the vigorous energy which they manifest on the conception of their ideas shows an immediate result, their interest may wane and another idea of equal vehemence replace the first.\n\nIt is most necessary for the native to acquire patience and perseverance. The mind must be trained to continue in one channel and the dissipation of the forces of life must be guarded against with the utmost care. The native must not be content merely to imagine his career; also he must not shrink from the spade work which is essential to bring ideas to fruition.\n\nThe Aries constitution is rather finely balanced; it is powerful, yet delicate. There is a decided tendency to overwork the body, either intellectually or physically. There is, however, no danger of nervous over-strain. Aries people are generally lacking in the psychic and spiritual qualities. Dangers to the health are indicated by the planets involved, but fevers and apoplexy are principally to be feared; and the native may also suffer from headaches and other afflictions of that extremity of the body. The expression is usually commanding, sometimes even violent, and the countenance may at times be red, while there is a likelihood of some mole or birthmark on the face. In itself, this position of the Sun does not promise any great longevity. Diseases are likely to be aggravated by the disposition, which is usually careless and even contemptuous of the health; the appetites are sometimes excessive and the passions need control. Speaking generally, this is a better place for the Sun in a male nativity than in that of a female.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011511,2,NULL,281,'Sun in Taurus',NULL,'# Sun in Taurus\n\nThe natural sympathy between the Sun and Venus makes Taurus a happy habitation for the Sun. The earthy quality of the sign, moreover, tends to stabilize his influence, and its balanced nature lends still further dignity to the configuration. Taurus people are usually broad, sturdy and of iron constitution. Their vitality is great, but with a tendency to sluggishness; they are slow to start, but, once in motion, they gather momentum, and when well under way nothing will ever stop them. In a word, they are weighty, using that word in its full mechanical sense. The will is dominant and even obstinate and the persistence and tenacity of the native are never in doubt. General Grant is an excellent example of this position of the Sun.\n\nLike other qualities, however, this tenacity may have its defects. The native is sometimes inclined to continue in a course which good judgment would see to be hopeless. Here we find in particular the devotees of lost causes. The reason for this is that Taurus being under Venus, the affections are strongly implicated. As a corollary, one may say that these people, though they can never be driven, may easily be led. They respond readily to appeals to their better feelings; at the same time to goad them is to rouse them to anger which may almost approximate madness.\n\nThe bull-nature is still further brought out by a certain placidity and domesticity in all cases where the more active qualities are not aroused. There is a great wealth of affection in this sign, which is frequently the aftermath of passion. In their love-affairs such people may begin with the vehemence of equinoctial gales, storm following storm. When this passes, the end comes not by breach or tragedy, but by the development of warm friendships. The disposition is thus ideal for marriage.\n\nThe mental activity of Taurus people is, as a rule, not great. Their original tendency is to be conservative, but if once convinced of the necessity of a revolutionary course, they will then pursue it to the bitter end. Even if on any point they seem radical, it is only accidental to the nature; on all fundamentals, they are reactionary. Consider Huxley, for example, the scientific side of his nature (Sag. Moon opp. Gem. Saturn) committed him to the advocacy of evolution, which was at that time misunderstood in England to imply belief in atheism, anarchy and free love. Yet his philosophical writings are based upon such comparatively early authors as Hume and Berkeley, while his political writings are the most steadily conservative that can be imagined.\n\nThe general inertia of the nature will cause the native to acquiesce in most of the conventionalities customary to his environment, not because he believes that they are right, (supposing him to be cross-examined on the subject) but because it would lead to trouble to ignore them. He would say frankly that he thought it did not matter very much what happened in so small a matter and that it was best &ldquo;to let sleeping dogs lie.&rdquo;\n\nPeople with the Sun in Taurus are usually very practical. They are not liable to be led away by idealism and dreams. One may quote Shakespeare as the most steady-going, sensible poet that ever lived. It is his extraordinary common sense which has so endeared him to the Anglo-Saxon. Spencer, too, has the Sun in this sign, and his philosophy was based upon objective facts. Hence, the name which he himself gave it, synthetic philosophy, as opposed to the analytic, which has held almost undisputed sway since the beginning of the science.\n\nIn the human anatomy, Taurus is said to rule the base of the brain, the neck and shoulders, and the throat. People with the Sun in this position are, to some extent, liable to disorders in one of these places, but, unless the Sun is badly afflicted, there is not the same danger of ill-health and of sudden death that we found in Aries, for while the Sun is not so brilliantly strong, he is more harmoniously placed and his rays fall more softly.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011512,2,NULL,537,'Sun in Gemini',NULL,'# Sun in Gemini\n\nIn Gemini the stability of the Sun is greatly diminished. The first principle of all mechanical efficiency is the fulcrum; a rigid base is necessary for every machine. An enormous proportion of the power developed for locomotion is wasted in hammering out a permanent way. If, therefore, the Sun, which is the fulcrum of the bodily machine, is in a movable, airy, mercurial sign, the working power of the engine is seriously diminished.\n\nIf Conan Doyle, Wagner, and Queen Victoria seem to be exceptions to this rule, it is because, in their cases, the Sun was still within a degree or two of Taurus and partakes very largely of his nature. In all these cases, too, it was well-aspected.\n\nSpeaking generally, people with the Sun in Gemini show a certain vagueness and irresponsibility, finding it hard to concentrate upon any subject or even to take any subject seriously. Even when their lives appear devoted to the prosecution of a particular object, it will seem as if there were no real basis in the nature corresponding to the observed effect. Their actions are prescribed by the mood of the moment, and they do things more because they are personally interested than with the idea of building up any important result for themselves. There is a great tendency to dissipate the force, and, owing to the dual nature of Gemini, such people are always happier when leading a double life. This expression in not used in any equivocal sense; it merely means that they are happiest when they have more than one dominant interest. They cannot stay, according to the expression, with their &ldquo;noses to the grindstone.&rdquo; Permanent work makes them restless and uneasy in a very short space of time. &ldquo;Variety is the spice of life&rdquo; to them, and, especially when Venus and Mercury are both in the same sign, they often become &ldquo;rolling stones,&rdquo; &ldquo;Jacks-of-all-trades and masters of none,&rdquo; unless there is some extremely stabilizing influence from a steady-going planet like Jupiter or Saturn, more especially Saturn. Thomas Moore is an excellent example of the lighter talents given by the Sun in this sign, and the versatility of Bulwer-Lytton is also a manifest confirmation of this position.\n\nMost of the force of the constitution and vitality of the native goes to nerve and intellect rather than to heart. We do not, as a rule, find people with warm dispositions having this position of the Sun. Albrecht Dürer, Bulwer-Lytton, Schumann, Strauss, are all examples of this. In the case of Jay Gould, this coldness of disposition is even more marked.\n\nGemini rules not only the nerves but the ratiocinative part of the brain, as distinguished from the executive, which is under Aries, the sensory as opposed to the motor function. It also rules the hands and arms and, in particular, the lungs. The general sensitiveness of the nerves is, however, an excellent token of artistry. People with this position of the Sun are likely to hear more, to see more, than the average man. They are open to impressions, even the most delicate, and, where Mercury assists, are able to record them with exquisite fidelity. The intellectual qualities are, moreover, fine and strong. Their apprehension is based on knowledge; their memories are excellent, and they build up splendidly on existing foundations. There is, however, not likely to be any tremendous force of originality in the mind, unless Mercury holds aspects to Uranus or Neptune. The student will remark that even Dante was greatly indebted to Virgil on the one hand, and to the Patristic authors on the other.\n\nSimilarly, Wagner went entirely to existing tradition for his material, and a good third of the originality of his music is due to his exquisite sensibility in regard to sound, while his whole plan, particularly the cry of the leitmotif, is rationalistic and literary, rather than musical.\n\nIt is part of the Gemini nature to demand a change of scene and relaxation; exercise, sleep and fresh air are necessary to the health, which, however, will never be robust in the same way as we find it when the Sun is in such a sign as Taurus and Leo. The native is really too high-strung and, unless things go his way, he readily becomes depressed. It will be useless for him to endeavor to settle down in any fixed occupation. The best he can do is to try to take advantage, as far as possible, of the qualities of his defects and so to arrange his life that the sword does not too quickly wear out its scabbard.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Jupiter, exalted in this sign, blends some of his qualities with the solar rays, but, unless the Sun is well-dignified, the working is not altogether favorable; for, since it is Jupiter&apos;s luxuriousness that is brought out, the Sun in this sign tends to laxness of life, giving a disposition too contented and easy-going, and a disinclination to exercise energy. The disposition is apt to be idle; lassitude seems to be the rule of life, yet with this is associated what passes for tenacity of purpose. Such changes as take place are superficial and leave the temperament and purpose undisturbed, but there is little manifestation of any real vigor or energy. These remarks apply to undeveloped types. Where the influence of Jupiter, who is exalted in Cancer, enters strongly into the development of the native, we may find indomitable will and an extremely masterful disposition. Such types are fairly well represented by John Quincy Adams, Joseph Chamberlain, Cecil Rhodes, Lord Northcliffe and Mrs. Pankhurst.\n\nA love of antiquity and of old, established things often manifests itself in the native, and he may take a deep interest in old books, paintings, bric-a-brac or in some such half-forgotten science as heraldry. The energetic type, on the other hand, occupies itself more exclusively with the affairs of the moment, and is apt to have a contempt for anything that is not entirely up-to-date.\n\nCancer rules the alimentary canal, as far as the bowels, which are under Virgo, and people with the Sun in this sign are often sufferers from indigestion, with functional troubles which may manifest in a hundred different forms, all of which can be traced to this original weakness, as occasionally caused by the implication of the pneumogastric nerve. The disposition of the native tends to confirm this threat against the health. The appetite is frequently both excessive and abnormal. Cancer being a watery sign, there is also a danger of over-indulgence in strong drink.\n\nEspecially when Venus is in the same sign, the sex appetite of the native is prone to be quite normal, and, being generally combined with strong affection and a placid disposition, this often makes for happiness in marriage.\n\nThis position of the Sun is not favorable to longevity. Children who come into the world about this time of the year seem not to get the necessary hardening, and the Moon, lady of the sign, being so easily influenced and so rapid in motion, evil directions come about, if not more frequently, yet at least with a much greater chance of shattering the citadel. On the other hand, as the native of Cancer grows older, his constitution grows more robust and he stands a good chance of reaching a fairly good old age. This is bound to be so for the reason that the Sun, in time, progresses into the sign Leo.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011514,2,NULL,1049,'Sun in Leo',NULL,'# Sun in Leo\n\nThe Sun in Leo is his greatest strength, for Leo is his own house and his influence is not even complicated by the exaltation of any other planet therein. We find here the most enormous vitality and strength of constitution. We have examples of this in such grand old men as Petrarch, who died at seventy, but whose life was full of vigor; Colonel Olcott who died at over eighty; Tennyson, at eighty-three; Cardinal Gibbons, at eighty-three, and Franz Josef of Austria, at eighty-six. Blavatsky died at sixty, but her Sun was in opposition to Jupiter and Uranus, while Cancer was rising, a sign not predisposing to longevity. Napoleon, too, died at the age of fifty-two, but this is hardly a case of natural death, since the indigestion indicated by the presence of Saturn in Cancer in opposition to the Moon was aggravated to malignant disease by the cruel regimen imposed upon him by his captors. Shelley also had a magnificent constitution and a vitality as superabundant as that of the great conqueror; his life, too, was cut short, by drowning&mdash;the manner being indicated by a conjunction of Mars and Neptune to the ruler of his 8th house, Jupiter.\n\nPeople with the Sun in Leo are not only strong themselves, but shed forth this strength on others. It is emotionally the most magnetic of all the signs for the Sun; perhaps in consequence of this, the disposition is usually masterful and may possibly in some cases become almost tyrannical. There is immense generosity and nobility of feeling, but this again may sometimes degenerate into extravagance. The native is a tremendous worker, but anything in the nature of menial tasks revolts his soul, and while he is not ashamed to do anything of this kind when necessity calls or as an example to others, yet he will not do it as a matter of routine, while there is anyone else to do it for him. If he finds himself in a situation where people will not do for him what he thinks they ought to, he generally prefers to let the work go undone. The nature is excessively proud and incapable of meanness. Such persons must be trusted or they can do nothing. As long as they feel that they are in positions of authority and responsibility, they will kill themselves if necessary, in order to justify the confidence reposed in them. If forced into any other situation, they will despise their work and so neglect it.\n\nThe disposition of persons with the Sun in Leo is placable and not easily perturbed, but this advantage is gained by &ldquo;preparedness.&rdquo; They give so forcibly the impression that they are ready for a fight that the peace is seldom in danger of being broken. When actually forced into combat, Leo people form the most determined opponents. They have taken to heart Shakespeare&apos;s advice:\n\n&ldquo;Beware of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in,\n\nBear&apos;t that the opposer may beware of thee.&rdquo;\n\nTheir only defect as fighters lies in their reckless courage. They expose themselves unnecessarily and they refuse to fight otherwise than fairly, however great may be the advantages offered. In victory they are magnanimous and in defeat unconquered.\n\nPeople with this position of the Sun should always attend, as far as possible, to their own business, and not rely upon others to do it for them, or trust to correspondence (unless they happen to be born writers, because of good Mercury aspects) for their success depends almost entirely upon the magnetism of their personality. The ambition of these people is nearly always uncontrollable; however much they get, they will want far more, and this discontent may be the cause of much unhappiness. It is the mainspring of their success, but may also bring them to disaster, for they refuse to realize it when they come to a blank wall. They are consequently likely to waste their strength in attempting impossibilities. The same pride and masterfulness of which mention has been made makes it impossible to coerce the native, but he responds with extreme readiness to the slightest appeal to his better feelings, and he will often injure himself seriously rather than give anyone the chance of thinking that he has acted meanly, although such thought may be utterly unjust.\n\nLeo rules the heart. The Sun in this position is very strong; it is because of his great power that the vitality is usually so tremendous, but when at the last, Apollo, lord of life and death, turns from the one to the other, it is at the heart that he will strike. Death is likely to come suddenly by some kind of stroke or by syncope. Where the Sun is over-excited by Mars, especially by squares and conjunctions, the tendency to diseases of the heart is greatly increased and may occur comparatively early in life. It may also lead to death in infancy through convulsions.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011515,2,NULL,1305,'Sun in Virgo',NULL,'# Sun in Virgo\n\nThe sign Virgo is almost as mercurial as that of Gemini, but, being of an earthy nature, it is rather the fixed than the volatile Mercury which it manifests. The natural coldness of Mercury is rather accentuated. The vitality is manifested upon the mental plane, but in a more practical way than was the case with Gemini. The ratiocinative power is strong and the sense of causality extremely so, but there is not the same tendency toward idealism as we saw with the sign of the Twins. Virgo is a practical sign; its native does not doubt the existence of spiritual planes, but the everyday facts of the world are apt to occupy his attention and prevent him from explorations into the unseen. The nature is just, but not overly sympathetic. The native is apt to be retiring and somewhat solitary. There is a certain shyness in the disposition which prevents the native from showing himself as he is, and this often makes it difficult for him to acquire the confidence of others. Even where this reserve wears off superficially through social intercourse, it still exists beneath the surface, and the real native is at heart unapproachable, as is seen in observing Goethe, Maeterlinck, Tolstoi, and Herbert Asquith.\n\nPeople with the Sun in Virgo are discriminative and keenly critical, but they are tactful and likely to keep their discoveries to themselves. They are accurate observers of detail, often very methodical, but, as a rule, have not the creative force necessary for successful generalization. The memory is excellent and retentive, but too apt to allow garnered facts to repose unused. The emotions are not easily aroused, nor easily quieted when aroused, but in no case do they play a great part in the disposition. There are few extremes in this sign. Generally even-balanced and cool-headed, the native makes few pretensions and works quietly and unobserved. But there is sometimes an inordinate pride in the intellectual ability, which may not be justified. Queen Elizabeth I is a notable example of this intellectual vanity. The critical quality is a valuable mental attainment, but one is not in the first class unless he can construct originally.\n\nVirgo rules the bowels and the sympathetic nervous system. The central nervous system of the human body is well symbolized by the caduceus of Mercury. The head of the wand is the cerebellum and the wings are the two halves of the cerebrum. The shaft is the spinal column and the snakes which surround it are the nadi, ida, and pingala, which surround the central shushumna in the Hindu anatomy. Thus, all mental and nervous forces in their most physical aspects are under Mercury. Many spinal complaints are, therefore, caused by afflictions of Virgo. Virgo also corresponds in man to the abdomen, ruling in this attribution the liver; the gall bladder and gall ducts; the spleen; pancreas and suprarenal capsules. The kidneys, acting as a filter, are under Libra. The remainder of the urinary apparatus is under Scorpio, which also rules the reproductive system. Capricornus is intimately connected with Scorpio and rules the muscular portion of the reproductive system, Scorpio being more concerned with the glands and their secretions. But an affliction of Virgo may lead to disease in any one of these parts sooner or later, through sympathetic response to any irritation of the spinal or glandular nerves. The Virgo native is greatly affected by worry and also by the magnetism of others, and care in diet is an extremely important factor in the preservation of his health.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011516,2,NULL,1561,'Sun in Libra',NULL,'# Sun in Libra\n\nThough the Sun is in his fall in Libra, the fact that this is a cardinal sign tends to restore his strength and on the whole the Venusian nature of the sign brings out more pleasing qualities than does the martial stimulus of Aries.\n\nThe disposition given by the Sun in Libra is extremely kind and sympathetic and the affection extraordinarily strong, but the sense of justice is extremely deep-rooted; and, if the native should feel that he is being abused or imposed upon, his indignation may make him seem cold and resentful. This same sense of justice seems to underlie every trait of the native. In religion, for example, he will not confine himself to any one system, but look for the best points in all and endeavor to strike a balance between them. Sometimes the delicacy of mental adjustment may be interpreted as indecision and, in undeveloped types, it may really amount to this weakness. It is certain that the native will not form snap judgments; he may prefer to suffer acutely himself rather than risk injustice to others. These people are also extremely sensitive in their feelings, and this makes them appear to some extent more dependent upon others than is the average person. They have an extremely powerful critical faculty, which, however, is sympathetic, and they are therefore generally appreciative. Their sense of harmony and proportion is admirable, and the native obtains the most intense pleasure from the contemplation of duty. Good examples of these qualities are found in Lord Roberts and Edward VI, both of whom have the Sun in this sign. Vulgarity revolts him and sometimes his disappointment in finding a suitable environment may bring out the Saturnian side of Libra and tend to make him try to live in a world of his own, or in some other way to be a recluse. Aspects of Saturn to the Sun increase this possibility.\n\nIn all matters involving accurate judgment, the native is at his best, but in practical matters he may be over-subtle. He may decline to believe a fact which is perfectly obvious to everybody else, just because it is thrust upon him.\n\nThe constitution is extremely sound, but does not manifest itself in strength or robustness. Endurance and the power of recuperation are its characteristics, The native will probably be of little good where sudden exertion is involved, but in the case of long continued strain, he will outlast men apparently much stronger. Libra is preeminently the feminine sign, far more so than Taurus.\n\nThe principal part of the body ruled by Libra is the lumbar region, which of course includes the kidneys and affects materially the spine. With good aspects of the Sun, however, troubles with these parts are apt to be only functional, and it frequently happens that a delicate adolescence is followed by a life of perfect harmony and balance of health.\n\nThere is one singular trait of the disposition in Libra which is so remarkable as to deserve special mention. It is brought out very strongly when Venus or Mercury or both are also present in the sign. It is this, that the nature of the individual is neither decidedly male nor female, but partakes almost equally of both qualities. This will not necessarily manifest itself outwardly, though sometimes it seems to have a great effect in the molding of the physical body.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011517,2,NULL,1817,'Sun in Scorpio',NULL,'# Sun in Scorpio\n\nThe Sun in Scorpio, the house of death, is very strong, but the native is very likely to suffer violence. It is quite frequently found that people with this position suffer from diseases which bring them to a premature end, as for example R.L. Stevenson and Stephen T. Crane, or, when badly aspected, they may meet a violent death like Marie Antoinette, President Garfield and Stanford White. This is physically the most magnetic sign in the Zodiac. There are three main types, classed respectively under eagle, serpent, and scorpion. But in every case, an extremely forceful and dominating personality is to be expected. With even the best types, the appearance is often somewhat austere. Tremendous will-power is evident in every line of the countenance,, which is frequently what conventional people call ugly and occasionally this native bears scars. This rather formidable appearance is, however, frequently combined with a kindly disposition. However dark and forbidding may be the countenance, the nature has yet the fascination of the serpent.\n\nThe native is easily aroused to anger, and makes a most dangerous enemy, for he cannot be trusted to fight fair, as with Leo, but will take any means in his power to injure his antagonist; nor is he held back by any feeling of pity, but will go on to the bitter end. Occasionally, this is so pronounced as to cause actual defect in the fighting quality.\n\nBut it is doubtful if any sign in the Zodiac illustrates so markedly the contrast between the spiritually awakened soul and its opposite. Crafty and cunning, with intense passions and jealousies and with a vindictiveness which will wreak insatiable revenges, the Scorpio native becomes, under higher impulses, indefatigable in his desire to help mankind, and his coldness and insensibility to the sufferings of others is transmuted into devotion and self-sacrifice. The coolness of demeanor and stern sense of justice and integrity, together with uncontrollable desire for freedom, may degenerate into harshness, selfishness and discontent, or blossom into efficiency, sympathy and true generosity.\n\nWhere the Sun is fairly well aspected and Mars is free from affliction, the constitution is extraordinarily strong; the resisting power is greater than with any other sign. The native is capable of infinite hard work and is most dogged, persevering and tenacious in carrying out his plans. He does not, however, go at them like a bull at a gate. He is always exercising his intelligence to out-maneuver his opponent. Where Scorpio assumes the eagle type, the noblest qualities of Mars and the Sun are found combined, and there is a certain, subtlety and intellectuality about them which come more from the nature of the sign itself than from either of the planets. There is no better sign in the Zodiac for commanding success, but this success nearly always comes through bitter fighting. There is a strong tendency to science and all other branches of life which demand the blending of the two qualities, energy and subtlety. Provided that the Sun is strengthened by some good aspects, it is as favorable a position as could be wished for him. At the same time, the student must never forget to expect something secret and sinister in the nature.\n\nScorpio rules the glands of the pelvis and, from its opposition to Taurus, often affects the corresponding parts in the neck and throat, but its most special signification is in connection with the organs of reproduction. Scorpio is particularly to be feared in the recurrence of Cancer after operations, for such secondary growths are usually glandular and such diseases are more dangerous than ordinary local afflictions of the reproductive organs.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011518,2,NULL,2073,'Sun in Sagittarius',NULL,'# Sun in Sagittarius\n\nThe Sun in Sagittarius is noble, refined, and forceful, but his influence may suffer through being too swift and sudden. The brilliancy conferred is sometimes fitful. The promise of youth remains unfulfilled. Occasionally, it may occur that it is fulfilled in some different way, it develops in some unexpected channel. Thus the qualities which brought Disraeli to the front were not at all those which confirmed him when he had arrived. The peculiar quality of high-strung and high-spirited character which this sign lends to the Sun is better shown by such people as Charles I, de Musset, Twain (Clemens), Kandinsky, and Winston Churchill. William Blake&apos;s Sun was very much stabilized by the conjunction of Mercury and Jupiter.\n\nThe native of Sagittarius seems never to be altogether in repose, but always to be prepared to act. The temperament is exceedingly proud and the taste exquisitely refined. There is often a kind of wild shyness in these people, and they are sometimes rather difficult to deal with, because they seem so ready to spring away, and vanish into the forest glades. This impression is, however, to some extent illusory, for their nature is essentially true and trustworthy, but the thought of humiliation is maddening to them, and they suffer the most intense pain over trifles which, to less sensitive people, would cause hardly a moment&apos;s annoyance. They resent intensely any form of pressure, almost as much so as in Leo, but they are to be trusted to follow out their own aspirations in their own way. If they say they will do a thing, they will not go back on their word. The intuition of these people is extraordinarily good, and their mistakes often come from not following it. No matter what reason may say, they will err if they do not rather choose to act on instinct, for, in them, instinct is so strong that it can never be banished from the mind, and so acts as an inhibition when contradicted. Similarly, these people are never fortunate in taking the advice of others. They should trust their own initiative. Their greatest successes are obtained when sudden emergency arises. Opportunity is to them the keynote of success in life. They are naturally capable of extreme concentration, and cannot well do two things at once. They must finish what they are doing before starting anything else; if they once break off, they find it hard to resume. There is some danger that they may go to extremes and those tasks which require patience and steady constructive force are distasteful to them.\n\nThe general health is good, although there is some liability to sudden attacks of nervous disorders, but the recuperative force is strong. An open-air life appeals naturally to the native and he is very fond of sports, especially those concerned with horses, dogs and forms of hunting. He is lithe and active, usually an excellent runner. The nature is free from any form of coarseness, and such things disgust even more than we found to be the case with Libra. This circumstance occasionally determines a rather peculiar attitude in regard to all the natural functions of life, and individuals with this position of the Sun are rarely normal in the sense in which ordinary people understand that word. There is a great desire to obtain the respect of others, and sometimes this may lead to a certain failure to live up to the best side of the character, for, to acquire or to retain the respect of unworthy persons, one must either be untrue to one&apos;s self or hypocritical. The personality is usually extremely magnetic, and its bold, free, dashing character and great brilliance often inspire the profoundest devotion.\n\nSagittarius rules the hips and thighs in particular, but all the tendons of the muscular system in general. It has also some connection with the motor impulses of the nervous system; the diseases of this sign are therefore sciatica, gout, hip disease, and some other forms of lameness. However, more octogenarians are born with the Sun in Sagittarius than in any other sign.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

He enters it at his annual re-birth, his resurrection from the dead, and it is therefore a new beginning to his force. The earthy, Saturnian, and Martial natures of the sign bring out the force of the Sun in the direction of practical energy. The capacity for hard work is the first characteristic which we observe in the Capricornus native. It is to be seen in such tremendous workers as Pasteur, Gladstone, Wallace, Sir Isaac Pitman, and Sir Isaac Newton, The leaping nature of the goat and the cardinal character of the sign also give the most tremendous power of initiative, a quality illustrated well enough by the people already mentioned. The character is extremely noble and self-respect is one of its strongest qualities. It is to be remembered that the natural mundane position of Capricornus in the Zodiac is the Midheaven. The Saturnian influence of the sign gives caution, prudence and thrift, as well as great solidity and strength of moral character. The native is very serious in disposition, with a strong sense of duty. These qualities may sometimes be exaggerated and become faults. Steadiness, foresight, trustworthiness, fidelity, and conscientiousness are nearly always present. In estimating the action of the Sun, due regard must, of course, be given to any afflictions, especially those by Mars or Uranus. Alexander VI had few of the qualities previously mentioned, but his Sun is squared by Uranus.\n\nThe constitution is usually of iron, capable of undergoing any degree of hardship, with great resisting power against disease. It is, therefore, next to Leo and Sagittarius, one of the best of all the signs for longevity. Capricornus governs the joints, particularly those of the knees, and has a general association with the bony system. The chief danger to the native&apos;s health is in rheumatism and in the tendency to over-indulgence in the appetites. He eats greedily of hot or spicy food, preferring it to any other. The Saturnian tendency to melancholia is also a dangerous element in this position of the Sun. Occasionally the morbidity of appetite leads, from the creation of an abnormal thirst, to similar indiscretions in regard to liquor. This, however, must be taken as a secondary and derived condition. The fact that the worst drunkards are often found to have the Sun in Capricorn comes largely from the mental or physical depression caused by Saturn.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

The woman is Isis Unveiled; she pours forth science, progress, nobility of thought and conduct, the wisdom of the stars, giving freely to others, while she herself is refreshed and renewed by that life-giving stream.\n\nBefore the discovery of Uranus in the eighteenth century, Saturn was supposed to rule Aquarius, but it is now quite apparent that Uranus is its lord, a domination which easily explains its signification of &ldquo;the future.&rdquo; In the consideration of the personal appearance under the discussion of the rising sign, we have noticed the peculiar and sometimes rather disconcerting look of the eyes of the native, as though the knowledge behind them were almost uncanny to the average person. The constitution is generally strong, though liable to sudden attacks of illness, which usually affect the nerves, or arise from some obscure cause, thus showing the Uranian influence, but his temperate habits of life are generally a good safeguard against danger from these tendencies. The disposition is kind and generous; the Aquarian cannot bear to see others suffer, and he will often make great sacrifices in order to relieve them. His judgment in practical things is not always sound, in the sense in which that term is usually employed, as his vision enables him to see too far ahead into the consequences to make his advice seem justified at the moment. What he says comes true, but often only after many vicissitudes. He judges on first principles and bed-rock facts, and the influence of these, though always finally determinative, may often be masked for a time by all kinds of accidents. To the average mind, therefore, the Aquarian often appears a dreamer, for he lays his plans so far ahead that he himself may never live to see them executed. Perhaps the most notable figure whose Sun is in Aquarius is Abraham Lincoln; other examples are found in Ruskin, Byron, Havelock Ellis, and Adelina Patti. A typical expression of the gospel of Aquarius is given by Thomas Paine, whose Sun is in this sign, in his exclamation: &ldquo;Every man a brother, every woman a sister, the world my country, to do good my religion.&rdquo;\n\nThe Aquarian is inquiring by nature and very susceptible to the illumination of inspiration, but he has no disinclination caused by prejudice to accept any theory which has facts to support it. The &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; has been carefully erased from his dictionary. The mental poise is generally equable, and the sense of justice, as well as that of causality, is very strong. The Aquarian is superior to his environment; his surroundings do not limit him as they would most people. Disappointment does not turn him from any plan, once his mind is firmly made up to prosecute it. The intuition is abnormally strong, truth is recognized by the native with great ease; and in conjunction with this, frequently goes very remarkable psychic power.\n\nThe mental poise of the Aquarian is so remarkable that he makes an ideal consultant, whether in medicine, in law, or in other science. People naturally go to him for advice; even the insane may feel the steadying power of his influence and the self-mastery which goes with it. In spite of all this, the native is modest and unassuming, and his interest is not so much in himself as in his surroundings. It is this which makes him an admirable observer and successful in science.\n\nThe Aquarian does not quickly make friends, but once his confidence is given, there is never any doubt about his loyalty. He is not easily approached on the physical plane. His bonds of attachment are forged in the smithies of the soul and the mind. This, as in the case of Libra and Sagittarius, may lead to the formation of many very peculiar attachments. The circle of the native is never likely to be conventional. He is happiest when he feels that he is fulfilling his destiny of helping others.\n\nAquarius rules the calves of the leg, in particular, but it also refers to the vessels of the body which carry fluid of any kind, particularly the lymphatic system. There is danger of high blood pressure in later years, and arteriosclerosis is not uncommonly the cause of the native&apos;s death. Because the preponderant influence of its ruler Uranus is upon the higher planes of mental and spiritual activity, the greatest danger to the health of the native is apt to come through neglect of the physical attributes of the body. He is disinclined to take physical exercise but is overactive mentally. His deep subjective knowledge, however, will not allow him to abuse his body, even though he may be unmindful of it and consequently it is seldom that his general health is seriously impaired.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Otherwise, there is a certain softness and placidity which diminish the vitality. The Pisces type is extraordinarily psychic, more so than is the case with that of any other sign, but this manifests itself in an entirely passive way. The native depends upon intuition and impressions generally, and the active qualities of the soul which make the great mystic are rarely present. Rudolph Steiner is fortunate enough to have aspects of Pluto, Uranus, Saturn and Mars, which increase his practical power. Picus de Mirandola is a more typical example of this sign. Unless the dignities of the planets concerned in this matter are extremely good, the native may suffer from illusions and be led constantly astray. There is in him a notable lack of correlation in practical details, and he is apt to leave things at loose ends. His constructive power being psychic does not exactly translate itself into the objective. In spite of this, however, there is a great deal of practical good sense in the composition, but sometimes the native will be accused of hypocrisy, owing to the extreme contrast between the idealism expressed and the course of action undertaken, and people not similarly constituted may take it into their heads to &ldquo;read them a lesson.&rdquo; The native is inclined to self-indulgence in emotional experience, and this in the undeveloped type very often takes the form of the abuse of alcoholic liquors or even occasionally of noxious drugs. This is partly due to the watery nature of the sign, and its ruler, Neptune, and partly to the soft and seductive influence of Venus, who is exalted in the sign, and to its connection with the Moon.\n\nThere is a good deal of discontent in this sign, naturally caused by such conflict between the aspirations and the expression of the life. This often manifests itself in restlessness and in inattentiveness, and in attaching far too much importance to trifles, the least of which often appears to them highly significant. Even in external manner, the native, though seemingly calm upon the surface, is full of tremor within, like the sea. The native is very fond of others and may be so solicitous as to their well-being that the result will often be trying to the recipient of his extreme devotion.\n\nThe constitution is, generally speaking, not particularly robust; the general health is good, but there is a lack of power to resist disease. The native is more susceptible than in almost any other sign. Michelangelo and Sir Richard Burton had magnificent constitutions, but the Sun being in the last decanate of Pisces, the influence of Mars is able to correct the general weakness.\n\nIn the human, body, Pisces rules primarily the feet, but his action extends throughout the whole body, over the lymph and all watery secretions of an excretory character, such as mucus. The principal diseases characteristic of this sign are edema, ascites, and dropsies (tissue swelling) in general. Another very common disease associated with Pisces is gout. In the consideration of Pisces as a rising sign, there is also danger of tuberculosis if the system is allowed to become depleted.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

It gives great brilliancy, acuteness, and susceptibility to the senses, but they are always on a terribly fine edge, so that extreme nervousness is likely to result. This may show itself in an extraordinarily quick temper, almost amounting to snappiness. Henry VIII, Robespierre, Swinburne, and Lord Northcliffe are all very good examples of this trait, which arose, not from any fault of temper or bad disposition in the ordinary sense, but from the intense over-strain upon them by the too great activity of the nerves which communicated impressions. In the case of women, where the life also is ruled by the Moon, we get an excellent example in George Sand. The directness and vividness of the sensations usually lead to great mental independence and activity; mental reaction takes place very rapidly. It is very difficult for persons with this position to doubt the evidence of their senses; and, unless some other aspects tend to diminish the executive power or to delay the operation of the judgment, the native will be so convinced as to the accuracy of whatever is presented to him that he will act immediately without consideration. For the same reason, the native is apt to resent authority and to be disinclined to listen to advice. There is a strong tendency to accept all ideas which are presented to one as merely emotional and to leave them thus; as if the mind were naturally attracted to Berkeleyan idealism. In consequence of this, and of the swift, almost automatic operation of action and reaction, the native is sometimes credited with originality, but this gift is often a defect, since it usually implies contradictions in thought, arising from a lack of reflection and correlation of the various trains of thought. Thus, for example, we see Swinburne reading a paragraph in the newspapers about the wrongs of somebody in Russia and flashing into print with a violent sonnet against the Czar or perhaps against kings in general. In the same way, Henry VIII would dismiss a trusted minister, perhaps send him to the block, in what was little better than a fit of temper.\n\nSuch people, however, are generally fortunate when they are in the exercise of professions where quick decision is everything to success, and where hesitation, however necessary to calm judgment, means failure. The position obtained by Lord Northcliffe in English journalism is evidently due, in great measure, to possession of this quality. His rashness may have led him into follies, but they did not matter, because everything was forgotten in the excitement of the next moment. This quickness to respond to impression is obviously likely to lead to the exhibition of qualities precisely contrary to those which are described as fidelity and domesticity. Every new fancy makes its full impression at once, and then passes, leaving little trace. When the Moon is in Taurus, taste and touch are probably more important to the native; in Aries, the best developed of the senses is usually sight.\n\nWhen the Moon is in Aries, the women in the life of the native are brilliant, passionate, headstrong, and impractical. They are very often intellectual and capable of immense initiative. As a general rule, in the case of a man, he will find it very difficult to control them, and, for the most part, his association with them will be short-lived, terminating more often than not, in quarrel. Where the Moon is well-aspected, they may be of the greatest use to him in his career. There is, however, no great promise of anything like enduring constancy on the part of the man.\n\nWe find Henry VIII, and others whom we have mentioned above, flitting from flower to flower like butterflies; but in not one of these cases do we find any woman in the life who exercised a permanent influence of a truly domestic character.\n\nMothers having children with the Moon in Aries must strive to be practical and avoid being too ambitious for them, allowing them to use their own judgment in selecting their playmates and amusements, and later in life, in deciding on their own career.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011535,2,NULL,3353,'Moon in Taurus',NULL,'# Moon in Taurus\n\nThe Moon in Taurus is in her exaltation; the sign tends to bring out the quiet and reflective side of the Moon and at the same time to steady her changeful nature. It is one of the best signs in which she can be found.\n\nPeople with the Moon in this sign hold to their impressions with extreme obstinacy; they react slowly, but with great vigor. They are almost as uncritical as the Moon in Aries type, but for totally different reasons. They remember accurately and tenaciously and they mould their actions for a long period on the original die. If any fact is communicated to them of a startling character, they manifest no excitement or distress. It sinks slowly into the mind, but instead of being held there for a long period without transmutation into motion, as we shall find happens when the Moon is in Cancer, a slow but purposeful decision with regard to that fact is undertaken, and, unless executive power be entirely wanting, owing to some affliction of Mars, action follows, steady, purposeful, and relentless. It is very difficult to make such people change their minds. You cannot make a person with the Moon in Aries change his mind, because, before you speak to him, he has already acted on his impression and forgotten about it; but with Taurus the case is different. His action has been taken and, however foolish and wrong you may prove it to be, it is his action and he goes on with it.\n\nWhen the Moon is in Aries, the best developed of the senses is usually sight; in Taurus, taste and touch are probably more important to the native. These people strongly resent interference with their ideas. They are so solidly impressed with what comes to them that they welcome only ideas which naturally cohere with the general temperament. This, of .course, tends to make the nature rather conservative and conventional.\n\nThe same type of conventional attitude is found in Dumas, in Joseph Chamberlain, in Arthur Balfour, and in President Garfield. Although Joseph Chamberlain was at first a radical, radicalism was conventional in Birmingham, which he represented. In the House of Commons, he drifted to conservatism of a very steady kind. It is not likely that any man with the Moon in this sign will break away from the fundamental principles in which he was brought up. As an apparent exception we have the case of Swedenborg; but here Uranus is within one degree of a conjunction of the Moon, the most upsetting circumstance that could possibly occur, Uranus being preeminently the planet of explosion. Yet even Swedenborg was not much more revolutionary than Virgil or Dante with regard to his ideas of Heaven and Hell; it was merely that he took them rather more seriously, a point of view that would naturally arise from the trine of Jupiter to that conjunction. There is no such breaking away from orthodoxy, if one considers the matter philosophically, as in the case of even such a reformer as John Calvin. Where the native is a woman, so that the Moon refers also to the life itself, her presence in this sign still further increases the obstinacy of the character as is evident in the case of Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nThe women who influence the native will be domestic, faithful, and of strong, enduring passion. Even an artist like Rossetti had the love of a truly devoted wife. It does not follow, however, that the relations will always be fortunate. Rossetti&apos;s wife died early. In the case of Queen Elizabeth I, we find a curious clinging tendency; and though Mary, Queen of Scots, had no Taurus in her disposition with regard to her male acquaintances, she had Taurus rising, and acted in an entirely Taurus manner toward her rival.\n\nThe dominion exercised upon the native by the women with whom he or she is associated will always be due to this characteristic; they will always apply steady pressure, though it may often be only that their fidelity appeals to the native and makes it impossible for him to get rid of them.\n\nMothers having children with the Moon in Taurus must not try to dominate their lives to such an extent as to rob them of their individuality, thus forcing them to turn to others for sympathy and understanding. Even though they may be most practical and devoted, they can easily arouse the stubbornness and antagonism of their children having the Moon in this sign.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011536,2,NULL,3609,'Moon in Gemini',NULL,'# Moon in Gemini\n\nGemini tends to accentuate the restlessness of the Moon, but it also develops the mental qualities and, where the native is engaged in an intellectual pursuit, the situation is not unfavorable. We see great mental activity in Dürer, Pasteur, and Tennyson, all of whom had this position. There is certainly a strong tendency to diminish the enjoyment of the senses, which are valued chiefly on account of the information which they give, and are, comparatively speaking, unconnected with the pleasures of the native. The effect is especially easy to remark in Alfred Tennyson, in whose poetry a certain lack of robustness indicates that the senses communicated rather with the reason or intellect than with the personality. This position is certainly an advantage in that kind of investigation where the presence of passion may act as an interference, but it is far from good where knowledge of and sympathy with humanity are required. Such a type of inhumanity is evident in the case of Ludwig II, of Bavaria.\n\nThe native is extraordinarily quick to receive impressions and to judge them with great accuracy, but there is not much depth in such judgment, and we find constantly that people with the Moon in this sign change their minds more readily than when she is in any other. The native is quick and eager to learn, but the part of the brain which attends to these matters seems rather disconnected with the deeper functions of the soul. There is a great readiness to communicate information acquired, and sometimes the native is over-loquacious. The critical faculty is good, though superficial, and there is not sufficient power to bring any given opinion into due relation with general experience. The inability to digest his observations is likely to cause the native to seek variety. If he reads a book, he partially assimilates it and throws it aside. He is likely to be unable to ruminate upon it and develop its ideas within himself, and he is consequently in need immediately of some new mental stimulus. This may find expression in love of travel, or, especially when the Moon is in the fifth house, in love of pleasure. In the absence of constant change, the nervous system may be very distressed. It seems to be rather a disadvantage for the Moon in Gemini to be strengthened by aspects. She is not sufficiently well-placed here to make it desirable for her to be too strong. Pasteur, for example, has no close aspect of any kind to his Moon. The relation of the senses to the soul is thus indicated by the Moon&apos;s position in the sign, but the other phases of the character are not absorbed into this in such a way as to hurt them.\n\nThis position of the Moon is much better in the case of women, the vitality being indicated by Luna; for the lack of ordinary feminine qualities often makes for success. Queen Victoria, Frances Willard, and Mme. Patti were saved by this position of the Moon from having their careers interrupted by too great insistence upon domestic matters or love-affairs. They were able to concentrate upon the mental side of their work. It is, of course, not a desirable position for any woman who looks forward to a normal, domestic life; for the woman with the Moon in Gemini must have strong intellectual interests, else the Gemini qualities appear in mere childishness, frivolity, and inconstancy.\n\nThe women with whom the native is intimately associated will either be mainly intellectual companions or they will be rather shallow and unreliable. It is, therefore, very important for the native to choose his or her female friends for brains, rather than for beauty. If he finds his affections seriously engaged, he may look for disappointment.\n\nThere is to be observed in them a very quick and delicate reaction to minute impression, which may sometimes seem to the observer like intuition, but is really operated in quite a different manner and should, by no means, be confounded with it.\n\nMothers who have children with the Moon in Gemini should strive to be more maternal in their attitude toward them and not allow their versatility and many interests to interfere with the personal attention which such children require. Otherwise, they may become too indifferent to their mother and the home influence.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011537,2,NULL,3865,'Moon in Cancer',NULL,'# Moon in Cancer\n\nThe Moon in Cancer is in her own house and she is stronger in this sign than in any other of the Zodiac. Its receptivity, placidity, and sensuousness are in complete harmony with her nature, and the Moon being dignified in the sign also tends to make her disposition less changeable, while the influence of Jupiter, who is exalted in the sign, takes away something of her coldness.\n\nThe senses of the native reflect with extreme accuracy the impressions presented to them. They sink into the mind and dissolve completely in it; the mind takes their mould with exquisite delicacy, but there is one drawback, in that, as a rule, there is little tendency to act upon the information they received. The mind is not idle, but rather meditative. Reaction is slow and uncertain. As a rule, the native lacks the intense energy which we associate with great creative genius, unless there are other indications in the horoscope; and these have to be pretty strong to overcome what may be called the contentment of the mind to remain passive. In the case of Sir Isaac Newton, we have a sextile of Mars to supply energy, and he is decidedly the most creative of the people on our list. But, even in his case, we observe the extreme thoroughness of reflection necessary to him before he began to give out again in a new form his deductions from the facts which he had absorbed. Baudelaire is another great creative genius, but his Moon is trined by Mercury, and yet this reflective quality of the mind is apparent, in the extraordinary repose of such writings as the &ldquo;Little Poems in Prose.&rdquo;\n\nIt follows, more or less, that the native will not go out of his way to obtain mental pabulum. This state of contentment with such impressions as come naturally to it may reveal itself as love of home and parents. There is usually a great deal of natural affection of the placid order; even the passion of love is likely to be gentle, peaceful, and perhaps romantic, when the Moon is in this sign. While the mind is not restless, it is very sensitive to impressions, though not at all in the way which we observed in the case of Gemini. There is no desire to acquire, merely a readiness to do so. One must be careful not to seek to upset the minds of people with this position, even for their own good. They will merely dislike you for doing so. It occasionally happens that the mind is psychic or mediumistic, but in any case the memory may be considered good. Blake is a first rate example of the Moon in this sign at her best.\n\nThe position is not really so good for women as for men. It makes them too passive, too easily influenced by those with whom they come in contact. Nell Gwyn is a notable example of this disposition.\n\nThe women with whom the native will come in close contact will be extremely warm-hearted and affectionate, sometimes maternal and sometimes romantic. Their affection will be enduring, and it may even be somewhat cloying. With bad aspects, the native may be seriously injured by the character of the women in his or her life. Byron, for example, with a retrograde Uranus in close conjunction with his Moon, was almost destroyed by women. It is probable, at all events, that they will be somewhat conventional and exacting, demanding more from the native than he will bestow upon them.\n\nMothers having children with the Moon in Cancer must avoid being so devoted and conventional in their attitude toward them as to make them too selfish or too dependent on the home influences. Many boys with the Moon so placed suffer from the &ldquo;Oedipus complex&rdquo; and later remain bachelors, or do not marry until after the mother&apos;s death.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011538,2,NULL,4121,'Moon in Leo',NULL,'# Moon in Leo\n\nLeo has an admirable effect on the Moon, the sign of the Sun linking her with the source of her life. Its influence tends to diminish both her coldness and her instability, and also redeems her from that darkness which is one of her drawbacks. While stronger in Cancer, where she is almost unmodified, the Moon is really better in Leo because her own nature is so imperfect that modification of some kind is necessary before we can consider her entirely excellent. With regard to the senses of people with the Moon in Leo, generally speaking, the sight is the best developed, but all the other senses should be thoroughly well balanced and healthy. A certain degree, however, of interest and even of affection for any subject must exist before the senses can give true and full communication. Unless the heart is in some way implicated, impressions do not easily reach the mind of the native. As a rule, for example, they have little curiosity, even scientific curiosity, but where the native is anxious to learn, he learns quickly and accurately, though his knowledge is always tinctured, to some extent, by his belief and emotions. It is extremely hard to convince a person with this position of the Moon, against his will; but when ready to receive impressions, no one apprehends them more quickly.\n\nWhere the Moon also indicates the personality, as in the case of women, or when Cancer is on the cusp of the Ascendant, the indication is particularly strong. The native is then very solar in character, positive, assertive, self-indulgent, noble, generous, and self-sacrificing, physically vital and robust, and mentally strong and decisive. There will also be great confidence born of the conviction that one is, as it were, a medium of the forces from beyond. This will naturally bring about initiative, capacity for leadership, and a hopeful and determined attitude toward life. The native is independent, and almost fanatically fond of freedom in the best sense of the word. He will refuse to recognize limitation; in some cases this will prove a disadvantage, as he may be inclined to dash his head against a brick wall. A fine example of this temperament is Anna Kingsford. The position does not seem nearly so favorable for a man, in whom it tends to produce a certain amount of conceit. The impressions that come to him will be rather inflated with a sense of his own vitality. They are not properly criticized and they expand, in his mind, unduly, sometimes even to a degree of megalomania. We all recognize a certain floridity with an over-valuing of little things in the characters of Oscar Wilde, James II, Louis XIV, Disraeli, and Abbas Effendi, which may be put down to this position. These remarks apply, to some extent, even to men who have Cancer rising, but they do not at all refer to women, who are usually as modest as they are excellent in all other ways.\n\nThe women in the life of the native will probably be the best of all influences to him, as they will be solar, and of the character described in speaking of women who have the Moon in Leo.\n\nMothers having children with the Moon in this sign will find it very difficult to avoid being too dictatorial in their attitude toward them; as a general rule, however, their influence on them will be excellent in a mental and spiritual way, even though they may not stress their physical and material needs, preferring to have the latter attended to by some one else.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

There is usually a good deal of materiality akin to pragmatism in the general tendency of the mind. The native does not, as a rule, value knowledge for its own sake, but, immediately on acquiring it, asks how it may be used. We have in this sign, many examples of the most eminent and practical minds: Edward VII, Paul Kruger, Lord Brougham, Cromwell, the late J. Pierpont Morgan, Winston Churchill (cusp with Leo), Joseph P. Kennedy, and Sainte Beuve being all good examples of the way in which the acquisitions of the mind are immediately put to service. Aspects from Mercury and Saturn obviously tend to increase the abstract power. This point is exemplified by a consideration of the Moon of Tolstoi, whose mind was decidedly lacking in practicality. Mercury and the Moon are only two degrees from conjunction, Mercury in his own house being evidently stronger than the Moon. Therefore, the influence of Mercury gives an additional touch of his nature to the Moon, thus causing her to act more as if she were in Gemini than in Virgo.\n\nThe native is very fastidious with regard to his impressions, analyzing and criticizing them with extreme care. He is genuinely anxious to acquire knowledge, but entertains strong prejudices. He has, however, a keen sense of truth, and is, generally speaking, ready to face facts.\n\nWomen born with the Moon in this sign are usually cold-blooded and ambitious, as was the case with Cleo de Merode. There is a certain lack of romantic sentiment, a calculating cleverness in their attitude toward men, which is repugnant to the average emotional man. Such women are generally good in the practical affairs of managing the home, but they are not likely to contribute very largely to its happiness. The women who influence them are usually very clever or intellectual and are rarely jealous of them.\n\nThe women associated with men who have the Moon in this sign will, as a rule, be rather of this same type. Generally speaking, their influence upon the man will not be very strong in a sentimental way, although they may admire their practicality and common sense.\n\nMothers having children with the Moon in Virgo should endeavor to be more affectionate or personal in their attitude toward them; they may display efficiency and common sense in their dealings with such children, but are inclined to call attention to faults which may later in life develop into virtues.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

The indications of the senses are principally valued on account of their reference to beauty, though, of course, a serious affliction of the Moon can entirely destroy this. Jay Gould, for example, has Saturn in conjunction retrograde, and Venus square, utterly killing the Venus or beauty sense. The presence of Saturn in the sign of his exaltation, obviously brings out the Saturnian qualities of Libra, while the square of Venus destroys her influence therein ; consequently, all that remains to Libra is the faculty of cold judgment, which of course, Gould possessed in an extremely high degree.\n\nThe quality of balanced judgment is quite universally manifest in Libra. With the Moon in this position, the senses report to the mind with unusual accuracy, and facts are criticized with great acumen. The matter is occasionally likely to rest there, for the airiness of the sign inhibits practicality. In many cases, the native remains in the contemplation of knowledge without turning it to immediate account. He builds up great ideas, but finds it difficult to execute them. A fine example of the critical judgment combined with considerable aesthetic perception is shown by Gladstone and Burton. Both acquired most extraordinary stores of knowledge and both put it forth in a most voluminous manner, but the great creative faculty was not equally well-developed. Gladstone&apos;s writings were far inferior to his power of moving men as a speaker. Burton&apos;s writings are of a high order, but they do not possess that indescribable quality which we find in the greatest of masters. This defect is, of course, not to be wholly ascribed to the position of the Moon. Very characteristic, too, is the awareness that it gives to men who have this placement of social life and the opposite sex, as seen in the artists Manet and Toulouse-Lautrec and in the writer Maeterlinck.\n\nOf women with the Moon in Libra, we have three examples, Mme. Blavatsky, Marie Antoinette and Emily Dickinson. In the first case, the Moon is particularly strong, being the lady of the Ascendant, and she is further dignified by a close trine of Uranus. The position in Libra indicates the keenness of her critical perception. The same power of introspection is shown by Emily Dickinson, whose perceptions are made accurate by sextiles from Mercury, Sun, and Venus in Sagittarius, but who was driven into mystic withdrawal by squares from Neptune and Jupiter in Capricorn. Marie Antoinette has the Moon extremely powerful, Cancer being the rising sign, but afflicted by a close square of Saturn. In this case, one may consider the influence of Libra, which is on the cusp of the fifth house, unusually strong.\n\nThe women with whom the native is intimately associated are likely to be distinguished, impersonal, delicate, refined, and subtly passionate. There is usually a danger of their exercising too strong an influence upon the life of the native, whether man or woman. Cardinal signs have an extraordinary power in determining the general horoscope, and unless the man&apos;s own important planets are equally strong, it is possible that women may sway his judgment to an undesirable extent. These women are not nearly as &ldquo;good&rdquo; in the old-fashioned, motherly sense of the word, as Cancer or Leo women. They are more attractive, more brilliant, but do not have the same solid qualities. Of course, they may be expected to possess talent, frequently artistic, and to live their own individual life even after marriage. This is not altogether a fortunate circumstance for the average man, who may either be henpecked or find his marriage little better than a new leaf of bachelorhood.\n\nMothers having children who have the Moon in Libra should do everything to inspire in them a feeling of pride and admiration; otherwise, regardless of the mother&apos;s devotion, such children can easily become indifferent and be attracted to other women who possess more charm or beauty.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Scorpio brings out the watery and sensuous side of the Moon, but tends to make her extremely positive and impassioned. People with this position are naturally hedonists, regarding the senses as vehicles of pleasure rather than of knowledge. These qualities, of course, may be overbalanced by aspects, as in the case of Herbert Spencer, whose Moon has the opposition of the Sun and a square of Mars. The interference of these planets eliminates the laxity of the sign, thereby allowing its scientific qualities freer scope. Thomas Moore, and Louis XVI, are, however, good examples of the hedonistic nature of the position. When, however, Scorpio tends to science, its effect is truly admirable, more so, perhaps, than any other sign. The senses are preternaturally acute and the powers of observation almost unlimited. The mind, too, reacts steadily, neither too quickly nor too slowly, to its impressions, and, unless there is some contrary indication in the horoscope, great will-power is indicated; for so strongly do the ideas presented take hold of the mind that it cannot rest in the mere acquisition of knowledge, but must construct, organize, and give out to the world what it has received.\n\nOne cannot say, however, that Scorpio is an altogether happy position for the Moon, for the tendency to sensuality is undoubtedly very great. This is especially dangerous in women born with this position. This sign influences the Moon in this respect more powerfully than it does Venus. Not only do we find a danger of sexual irregularity or excess, but a strong predisposition to indulgence in liquor.\n\nThe women with whom the native is associated are apt to be very strongly sexed, self-willed, and somewhat unscrupulous in attaining their ends. They may be deceitful and treacherous; this, of course, applies to bad cases only. But where the Moon of the native is well-dignified, he will meet the better type of Scorpio woman, courageous, ambitious, enterprising, and endowed with executive power. In spite of these facts, it does not necessarily follow that women will play a very important part in the life of the native. Scorpio is the weakest sign as well as the strongest. There is an element of corruption in it, unless well-dignified, which makes it sometimes practically void of influence or extremely limited and intermittent in its operation. One may consequently expect rather extreme cases; in the case of a man with this position, one may be utterly ruined by women, another will pass through life almost entirely uninfluenced by them.\n\nMothers having children who have the Moon in Scorpio should guard against allowing their ambition for them to overshadow their tender emotions. They should avoid influencing such children to such an extent as to interfere with any latent talent or natural inclination in choosing a career.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Almost all the femininity in her is taken away. There is no passive acquiescence in the information conveyed by the senses. The prophetic or inspirational sense is keen, more so than when the Moon is in any other sign. There is hardly any plasticity in the attitude of the native to life. The impressions are admirably focused&mdash;the picture presented to the mind is entirely without blurring, perfectly sharp and well-defined. The mind has consequently to deal with clearer images than when the Moon is in any other sign, and therefore one most important element, in the formation of judgment, is quite perfect, and the judgment is almost preternaturally acute. We find the coldest and clearest intelligences with this position of the Moon. This fact almost leads us to think that the main cause of mental obfuscation may be original defective presentation of the non-ego to the ego through a fault in what one may call the lens. The student will note the extraordinary clearness and concentration of the mental vision of such men of science as Copernicus, Huxley, Alfred Russell Wallace, and Humphry Davy, of a philosopher like Sir William Hamilton, and of novelists like Balzac, Victor Hugo, and one may even add, Dickens. If the observation of humanity is, to some extent, in this last case somewhat distorted by his whimsical method of portraiture, so that his creations appear like caricatures, the reason is that Neptune was in direct conjunction with the Moon. In the political world, we have an excellent example of singularly clear and simple vision in the case of orator and statesman John Bright. The minds of people with the Moon in this sign appear to resent any confusion of issues, and are always afraid of being cheated by the introduction of facts which are foreign to the subjects under discussion. The extreme breadth of vision in Balzac may be set down to the close square of Uranus to the Moon, which enlarges the outlook and makes it more vital. In the case of the men of science mentioned above, one must note the limitation of their work. Much of the success which they obtained was due to their faculty of attending to one thing at a time. This made them, in some way, a little narrow and one-sided, as compared with universal geniuses like Newton. To produce a man like Newton, one would have to combine a Huxley and a Hamilton. The reaction of the mind to the senses, when the Moon is in this sign, is extremely quick and keen, but the reflective qualities are usually not great, unless developed by favorable aspects of the major planets.\n\nWomen born with this position of the Moon will have very much the same quality as they would have were Sagittarius rising.\n\nThe women who come closely into the life of the native will be of a high type, delicate, refined, yet keenly passionate and, at the same time, almost too ethereal to satisfy the tastes of the average man. There will also be difficulty in holding them. Gentle and timid as deer, the slightest sound alarms them and they may dash off into the depths of the woodland. They are not domestic, unless from a sense of duty, but they make admirable companions, particularly in outdoor sports. The native will find amusement with them, but may find it difficult to make them practical.\n\nWomen having the Moon in this sign will attract high-minded, religious and admirable women, and seldom suffer, if at all, from their jealousy or enmity, unless, of course, their Moon is badly aspected.\n\nMothers having children with the Moon in Sagittarius may give too much thought to their spiritual and mental needs at the expense of their emotional requirements. They should strive to display more affection and sympathy toward such children.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Almost the worst feature of the Moon is her coldness, and this Capricorn accentuates. The senses of people with the Moon in this sign are not likely to be particularly acute. The mental response to impression is rather quick, angry, and antagonistic, yet there is an extreme keenness to receive information. Where the Moon is well-dignified, this may be of very happy augury. There is a faculty for unusual quickness of judgment, the power of sudden and correct decision, seen particularly in Napoleon, but also in Augustus Caesar, Darwin, Hitler, Lincoln, Patton, and Washington.\n\nBismarck has a wide sextile of Mercury, a trine of Venus, a square of the Sun and Jupiter, and semi-sextiles of Saturn and Uranus, all of which aspects may be taken as greatly strengthening and solidifying the mental reaction. We often find, however, illusions of sense, sometimes so serious as almost to justify ascribing their cause to what is called obsession. It is usually a case of definite obsession that we find with the Moon in Capricorn, differing from her nature in Pisces, where we get a different kind of dream-world, the romantic sphere of the poet and the mystic. In Capricorn, the Moon often gives a tendency in persons of the average type to intoxication, always in the nature of obsession. This tendency to obsession is certainly the most characteristic of all the qualities of the Moon in Capricorn. Even in the best cases, people with this position tend to have the idea fixed. Bismarck, Napoleon, and Savonarola are obvious examples. In their cases, the fixed idea was very much in tune with the general purpose of the life, and so was not an affliction, but in a case like that of George III, who had Uranus in conjunction with his Moon and Mars square, there could be no result but madness.\n\nMary, Queen of Scots, and George Eliot, both had somewhat of a morbid strain, and it is evident that neither of them possessed the disposition to make any man permanently happy. The position of their Moon is to be held, for the most part, responsible for this. There is also in women an evident tendency to brood, and brooding is often a condition antecedent to obsession.\n\nThe women with whom the native will probably be associated may possess excellent practical qualities, but they will be apt to be exacting and capricious, sometimes exceedingly cold and unsympathetic, or, if not cold, they may have a callous quality which is almost worse than coldness. They will, however, in all probability be thoroughly reliable, and possess a strong sense of moral responsibility. They will also be patient, and generally speaking, faithful, but the callousness of their disposition will hardly be conducive to the happiness of the men whose lives they influence. If the reader will run his eye back over the people mentioned as having the Moon in this sign, and add the names of Isaac Pitman, Cicero, and Edward VI, he will notice that in none of these cases have women played a really important part in the life, for sympathy is the true foundation of influence. The most important woman in the life of Pisces Sun composer Frédéric Chopin ended up being the independent and assertive George Sand&mdash;his Capricorn Moon was favored by sextiles from Uranus and Pluto.\n\nWomen having the Moon in this sign attract women who are not in sympathy with them. They are more likely to benefit their women friends than to receive benefit from them.\n\nMothers having children with the Moon in Capricorn will be naturally efficient and practical regarding their physical and material needs; unless they can be proud of such children, however, they will seldom give them the love and sympathy which the children will naturally crave.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

It represents her at her very best. The touch of coldness and inhumanity is no longer there. The sterility and instability are taken away. The indications afforded by the senses are admirable; not only are they accurate, but their effect upon the mind is altogether what it should be. There is the scientific attitude, but there is also the human interest. There is no error either toward emotionalism or sentimentality or rationalism. The reaction is strong and neither too swift nor too slow. We may take as the best examples of this position of the Moon, Wagner and Conan Doyle. Here we find, almost equally in both cases, the spiritual instinct, the humanitarian instinct, the sex instinct and the scientific instinct all admirably developed and not one of them over-developed. Both were familiar with the science of the period, but neither became an extremist. Both followed their religious and spiritual instincts, but without undue fanaticism on the one hand or skepticism on the other. People with this position are always likely to be somewhat in advance of their contemporaries, but this advance will be of an all-round character&mdash;not distorted or even one-sided. This is a very rare and perfect circumstance. The majority of so-called advanced thinkers have merely a disproportion of over-development on some one line, but people with the Moon in Aquarius are so well-balanced that it is rare for them to upset their contemporaries by an extravagance of views. This universality of interest nearly always tends to make the native a charming companion, whose conversation is always well worth listening to. It is difficult for the native to be satisfied with any one individual; his sympathies move in too many channels. He may, therefore, give more pleasure to his friends than they to him.\n\nThis sign is not altogether so fortunate as the home of the Moon in the case of a woman. She becomes almost too Aquarian, and even a good quality can be overdone. There will probably be some lack of heart, unless there is a corresponding correction, as for example the Sun in Cancer or Leo.\n\nThe women in the native&apos;s life will be much above the average, loyal, broad-minded, intelligent, and while, to some extent, idealistic, they will indubitably prove of the greatest practical assistance to the native, whether man or woman, particularly if his career lies in some such direction as is indicated by the sign itself.\n\nMothers having children with the Moon in Aquarius are likely to play the part of a chum and companion with them, but they should avoid being too indulgent or unselfish in their attitude toward them.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011545,2,NULL,5913,'Moon in Pisces',NULL,'# Moon in Pisces\n\nThe Moon and Pisces are peculiarly sympathetic. Taken by itself, there is great danger that the person with this position may receive totally false impressions through the senses. There is an excessive tendency to optimism and romanticism; Don Quixote must have had the Moon in Pisces. Among real people we find it in the horoscopes of Shelley, Goethe, Petrarch, and Stevenson. This position accounts for their extraordinary refusal to accept things as they are. The outside world came to them through such colored glasses that everything appeared bathed in a luminous mist.\n\nThe reader will note, however, that, of these persons, Goethe alone had also the scientific attitude, the sense of realism; and Goethe&apos;s greatness really consists in his ability to blend these totally opposite qualities of the mind. The explanation is that, in his case, Saturn was square to Uranus, the latter planet being in the third house; a square of Saturn and Mercury would have done equally well. But unless there be some such compensation, we do not find any power of realizing the facts of life with accuracy. The skeptical quality is absent. Cardinal Gibbons, for example, could not entertain any objection to his faith. Mabel Collins, similarly accepting the main theory of her theosophical faith, weaves happy dreams. She has the Moon joined to Neptune in Pisces and Saturn conjoins Uranus in placid Taurus in the seventh house. We do not find in her any philosophical interest in its tenets.\n\nSimilarly, people like Hans Knappertsbusch and Rosa Bonheur take the masterpieces of great artists&mdash;in the one case Wagner, in the other the creator of that horse &ldquo;whose neck God clothed with thunder&rdquo;&mdash;and interpret them very nicely, very correctly, but with absolute lack of any analytical or critical faculty. The great artist is always a great realist, however romantic he may be, and however idealistic, for beauty is but the garment of truth; and if there is no truth behind apparent beauty, be sure that your eyes have once more deceived you. Now, the tendency of Pisces is always to present things in symbolic form. The veil between the gross and the subtle world is but a spider&apos;s web, so far as Pisces is concerned. This is what makes the sign so astoundingly psychic.\n\nA great deal will depend upon the dignity of the Moon. If she has such good aspects as Mars trine or sextile to make her active, or if a favorable ray from Uranus or the Sun fall upon her, then she gives true vision. If she is afflicted, especially by Saturn, Neptune, Uranus, Mars, or Jupiter, she is likely to bring the most diseased fancies to birth and to harbor the grossest illusions. In fact Pisces may be either the best or the worst of all the places of the Moon, but, in view of what we have said, it appears that the tendency to illusion is so strong that, taken by itself, the position is not a good one in a world where capacity to look facts in the face is the principal asset of the masters of life. People can get into far more trouble through believing the best about everything than through believing the worst. A pleasant surprise can do no harm; an unpleasant one may upset one completely.\n\nOne of the most dangerous features of this position of the Moon is that the need to see everything through rose-tinted spectacles often drives the native to indulgence in drink or drugs, which temporarily renews the illusion that everything is beautiful. Any aspect of Neptune to the Moon will naturally accentuate this tendency. It must never be forgotten how closely allied are the temperamental qualities of Neptune and Pisces.\n\nWomen with the Moon in this sign fill the above description even more closely than do men. It makes their romanticism and, to a certain extent, their other-worldliness, extraordinarily strong. Sometimes, like Lillie Langtry, they are able to turn these qualities to great advantage. In her case, though Neptune was in conjunction with the Moon, the sextile of Uranus and the square of Saturn gave her balance. Without these aspects, she might have been so self-sacrificing, generous, and passive, that she would have been the prey of every unscrupulous person with whom she came in touch.\n\nThe women with whom the native is closely associated will be, as a rule, highly emotional, extremely unselfish, romantic, voluptuous, passionate, and sometimes dreamy. They take love to the highest planes and have the power of making themselves appear of extravagant value in the eyes of the native. In the case of a man they will thus enable him to gain pleasure and happiness from their affection, but as a general rule, they will not be of much help to him in his career. In a general way, the woman devotes herself to the man so completely that she has little care for anything in the world but his devotion. She may be, however, extremely useful to him by romantically inspiring him and making him happy.\n\nMothers having children who have the Moon in Pisces must avoid being so unselfish and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; in their attitude toward them as to unconsciously develop their weakest points and to undermine their character and their will-power.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

The mind of the native is slow, patient, solid and constructive, and often obstinate. He may have a great intellect, but often may learn more from travel and experience than from books. There is, however, frequently some tendency to mental inertia, and this nearly always expresses itself as conservatism. Such minds resist new ideas. Consider Queen Victoria, the most successful reactionary of the nineteenth century. She came to a throne already tottering beneath the blows of the French Revolution, and of such thinkers as Shelley, and she smothered Republicanism by &ldquo;fighting the fight of sit-down&rdquo; until at her Jubilee she was more firmly seated than any Tudor!\n\nHuxley, too, for all his brilliancy and originality was in some ways as conservative as his Queen. In science he never jumped at conclusions; he was, perhaps, the most cautious and profound thinker, both in science and in philosophy, that England had produced. Similar qualities, not so well-dignified, are visible in General Boulanger and George V. In them there is some hanging back noticeable; hesitation just where dash was wanted!

There is danger of over-development of the mind at the expense of the vital forces, of living too wholly on the mental plane, of restlessness and anxiety and overwork, which errors may culminate in nervous breakdown. Ill aspects of Neptune, the Moon, and Uranus confirm this threat.\n\nThe mind of such people is often singularly lucid, but intellectually, rather than instinctively or intuitively. They rationalize admirably, but nearly always neglect more important considerations. Their logical processes are perfect, but they are apt to generalize from insufficient data, or to omit some cardinal fact in their premises. They are often, therefore, regarded as silly, though never as stupid. Their superficial rapidity of mind often makes them good public speakers or journalists, for rapidity is an essential mental qualification in these professions, and their facility in logical process without rigid insistence upon precedent fact makes them successful lawyers.\n\nThey possess great versatility; often too much, sometimes lacking steadiness and application. They are easily influenced by their environment; a slight matter starts them off on a new trail. Where the hearing is good, they make fine linguists, but, unless Mercury is fortified by good aspects of the heavier planets, not especially adapted for any of the deeper modes of thought. Plato and Dante Alighieri are the greatest names upon our list, and in both cases Mercury is greatly steadied and helped by Saturn and Uranus. In the second rank we find George Sand, Thomas Hardy, and Bulwer-Lytton. Richard Strauss, whose Mercury is in the last degree of Taurus and therefore blends the influences of both signs, may perhaps be worthy of the first-class. But more characteristic of Gemini is the coldly intellectual quality of mind shown by George III, Robespierre, Brigham Young, Jay Gould, and Abbas Effendi. There is something colorless and bloodless about the manner of thought of all these people, which puts them in a class apart. Yet more typical of the purely mental and superficial character of this position of Mercury is George Bidder, the &ldquo;Lightning Calculator.&rdquo; The mind in such a case is as merely a machine as if it were made of metal; and this is the essentially mental quality, and the occasion of St. Paul&apos;s remark, &ldquo;The carnal mind is enmity against God.&rdquo;','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

The result is often seen in poor memory, particularly in old age, although, if the planet be well dignified, the mind may be singularly retentive, particularly in the matter of history. In fact, the tendency is often to assimilate precedent, and rather to refer to antiquity than to reason upon actualities. It is good for such persons as may be occupied in what may be called the by ways of life. Dealers in antiquities, bibliophiles, bookworms, and to a less extent, lawyers, may find some advantage in this position.\n\nThere is in all cases a decided lack of the sense of actuality, and, above all, of originality. Yet the intuition is often exceedingly good; such people may know, without being told, and without knowing how they know. The understanding is usually excellent, and the sympathy is easily excited. On the other hand, where these people dislike, the feeling is intense; they cannot endure the company of those who are not in harmony with them. Yet, although sensitive, they are more tolerant than the average person. The contrast in this respect with people who have Mercury in Scorpio is singularly well marked; for the latter, although they may deem it politic to conceal their contempt for inferior minds, keep inwardly the most extraordinary bitterness. Mercury in Cancer is really tolerant; its natives have the sense that opinions are, after all, not of supreme importance. They are, too, not always aware of their own defect of memory and lack of logic. Here one must pause, confronted by the fact that the most marvelous memory in the world, that of &ldquo;Datas, The Memory Man&rdquo; (W.J.M. Bottle) and the most powerful rationalizing mind of modern times, that of Bernard Shaw, both came under Mercury in Cancer. But &ldquo;Datas&rdquo; was born when Mercury was stationary, just two days after the planet turned direct, with Venus in exact conjunction, and his memory is purely detached and self-sufficient, and exclusively historical. He remembers dates, and dates only; and he remembers them in a mechanical manner, absolutely, and not because of their relation to other matters. This is in fact the precise type of memory indicated above as characteristic of this position. The case of Bernard Shaw is explained by the exact trine of Neptune to Mercury, which gives him his extraordinary faculty of detecting the falsity of conventional thought.\n\nIt may also be mentioned that the effect of Cancer is to make Mercury sway to the purely passive side. The mind is unusually impressionable, and though the inscriptions thereupon be &ldquo;writ in water,&rdquo; yet for the moment they sway the native. There is little real stability in the mind, and yet it falls easily into habit, which may be obstinate if subjected for long periods to a single stress. The position inclines to mental idleness, and any powerful will can easily obtain dominion over the mind of the native by appealing to the senses rather than by argument, which arouses obstinate resistance. All this being peculiarly contrary to the best attributes of mind, we must regard Cancer as one of the less fortunate positions for Mercury.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

As &ldquo;the adolescent&rdquo; among the planets, the solar influence is just what he needs &ldquo;to make a man of him.&rdquo; In other language, it may be said that this position adds heart to brain; and brain without heart is the essence of all mischief -- the intellectuality of Mephistopheles. There are, of course, certain dangers, notably a tendency to pride and anger, sometimes to bombast and boastfulness. Ambition, too, is a common quality; but ambition is a virtue unless it is ill-regulated. Since the Sun is more frequently than not in the same sign as Mercury, in this particular case it follows that, as lord of Leo, he is generally stronger than his satellite, and this tends still further to steady him.\n\nTaking a comprehensive view, one may affirm that this is one of the best possible positions for Mercury. As we have noticed in dealing with other planets, it is not always well for them to be too strongly reinforced in their own essential qualities. Mercury in mercurial signs may prove too mercurial, just as Mars in martial signs is often over-martial. Every planet needs balance, and the lesser planets need it more than the greater. Accordingly, we discover this position of Mercury in the nativities of some of the greatest of mankind. Who more admirably illustrates greatness of heart and brain than Cardinal Gibbons, in our own times? Or if we must choose a rival, in these qualities, what of Cecil Rhodes? Looking backward we have yet greater names and in each case we shall note this remarkable balancing of the highest intelligence by the human touch, this harmonious union of the perceptive and the emotional qualities. This it is that colored the intellectuality of Petrarch with the ray of love. Here, too, must we look for the condition that brought the genius of Goethe and of Napoleon into sympathetic touch with their lesser fellows; and it is this same tempering of perspicacity with the &ldquo;human element&rdquo; that made Lord Northcliffe the greatest journalist of his period in England.\n\nVirgo may lend Mercury more acuteness, Aquarius more lofty passion; but Leo is the fitting place for the mental ruler of the &ldquo;man of the people.&rdquo;','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011563,2,NULL,7449,'Mercury in Virgo',NULL,'# Mercury in Virgo\n\nIn this sign Mercury is not only in his own house, but also in the house of his exaltation, and it is natural to suppose that he will be stronger and more excellent here than anywhere else in the Zodiac. To a great extent this is the case. So far as Mercury is sufficient, he is admirable; and it is irrational to blame Mercury because he is not also Venus! Yet this is the danger: A native with Mercury so placed may be overwhelmed by this part of his character. Virgo, however, is much to be preferred to Gemini as a place for the mental ruler; the duplicity of the Twin-sign is avoided, and Virgo, being an earthy sign, tends to add stability to the planet.\n\nThe extreme development of intellect naturally causes a certain coldness and detachment; people thus endowed sometimes forget that this world is not altogether ruled by reason, but very largely by prejudice, emotion, and self-interest. They are, therefore, better fitted to deal with abstractions than with practical affairs; Leo is much better than Virgo for the man of the world. The great men are the true men, no doubt; but this is exactly why the great men are often never discovered until they have been dead for many years.\n\nPeople with Mercury in Virgo are quick to learn; indeed they often learn so easily that they do not concentrate sufficiently to retain their acquired knowledge. They have excellent memories subject to exactly the same limitations. They are often fertile of fancy, make excellent linguists, and good orators. Their mind is well adapted for scientific inquiry and, if Mercury is strengthened by Saturnian wisdom, their attainment in Science may be really profound. They are clever in handicrafts, and should excel in scientific agriculture. The mind, too, is essentially honest. As lawyers they are not so sharp as those with Mercury in Gemini. There is much plasticity and receptiveness, moreover, in the mind; and they are easily influenced, especially by argument.\n\nOn the other hand, they are sharply critical, sometimes too much so, though this trait rarely takes so aggressive a form as when Mercury is in Scorpio. They are intolerant towards stupidity in others and cannot understand the point of view of &ldquo;common sense,&rdquo; when it conflicts with their reasoned judgment. In a sense they are idealists as much as those who live in an emotional dream-world, and are just as fanatical, though in the opposite camp. They take &ldquo;the world as it ought to be&rdquo; (in their opinion) instead of the world as it is.\n\nFrom this fault come the practical blunders of such really magnificent intellects as those of Anna Kingsford and Mme. Blavatsky. Shelley and Tolstoi had this same limitation. Each &ldquo;proved conclusively&rdquo; that a certain course of action was correct; and each was amazed that humanity remained unconvinced.\n\nIn pure philosophy this does not apply. Sir William Hamilton, dealing with the abstractions of metaphysics, was content to leave his work where he found it, on the intellectual plane. In politics, too, the coldness of perception often sets as an advantage. Witness: Franz Josef and Louis XIV. Both these monarchs were able to pursue a difficult policy with success because of their detachment from emotional considerations. Mr. Asquith, Cardinal Richelieu, and Sadi Carnot may be cited as further examples. On the other hand, Louis XVI and Ludwig II of Bavaria failed from this identical course; they were not identified with politics in the same way as those just mentioned, and they lost their thrones and their lives from lack of interest.\n\nIt is to be noticed that every single one of these people could see only his own point of view, and rode roughshod over his opponents. There is much selfishness in intellectuality, and even where the heart is humanitarian, this lurks unsuspected by the native. Consider the pain given to the very objects of their devotion by Shelley and Tolstoi. A little human silliness and weakness would have been much more productive of human happiness! Man shall not live by syllogisms alone, even though each one be an ideal formula for the production of perfection.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

There is generally a quick intuitive flash of conviction followed by the attempt to weigh the decision logically, which is often dangerous. The better policy would be to train the mind to follow its intuitions. It is the old story of the ass who starved between two thistles because he could not decide which he would eat first. In matters where mind is the sole consideration, however, Libra is as good a sign as can be found for Mercury. The Venusian nature softens the metallic coldness of the Mercurial nature, and Saturn being exalted in Libra, there is an added element of wisdom which pure reason lacks. The real drawback is in the airy nature of the sign, which may give a certain looseness and even frivolity to the disposition of the mind. There is usually great ambition for intellectual accomplishments, but little inclination to labor to attain them. The mind easily becomes distracted; sometimes we may find the native &ldquo;Jack of all trades, and master of none,&rdquo; as the saying goes.\n\nSuch people, too, have the defect common to the open mind; they form an opinion after long and careful study, and yet may abandon it at a moment&apos;s notice on quite inadequate grounds. The sensitive balance of the mind makes it very difficult to speak positively about such people without the fullest study of the whole horoscope. With this position we find the most varied accomplishments. Great mystics and artists like Coleridge, great lexicographers like Sir Richard Quain, great statesmen like Kruger, great lawyers like Lord Brougham, great theologians like Savonarola, great scholars like Erasmus, great philosophers like Cornelius Agrippa, great rulers like Queen Elizabeth I, great actresses like Mrs. Langtry, great courtesans like Cleo de Merode&mdash;all come under this possibility. One cannot tell merely from the position itself along what lines the mind may move, or even how it will work, as Mercury in this sign is more sensitive and pliable than in any other.\n\nThe position may, however, be called good; it is rare to find a thoroughly incompetent mentality with Mercury in this sign; such an event is unlikely to occur unless there be serious affliction. Unless, however, there are some good aspects to strengthen Mercury, the mind is likely to be shallow.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

People with Mercury in this sign are far-seeing and clear-sighted; it is almost impossible to deceive them, but on the contrary they are often over-critical and sometimes incurably suspicious. The thought is bitter and eager, often vitriolic, and the word follows suit. They have an uncanny faculty of knowing exactly where to wound. They make admirable vivisectors on every plane, and they are usually quite unscrupulous in their methods and careless of what pain they may inflict. Furthermore, they are intensely secretive; they hate to commit themselves to any positive statement, but their capacity for insinuation and innuendo may well be described as infernal. They make the most dangerous enemies, and in some cases (though, fortunately, this is rare) there is something of the snake in their temperament, and they may turn suddenly and treacherously upon their antagonists. They make excellent secret-service men. They are capable of long continued dissimulation and, the imagination being exceedingly vivid, they are well fitted to deceive others. With all these qualities, goes an intense skepticism, an intolerance of the opinions of others whom they regard as inferior, and a supreme contempt for those who disagree with them. On the other hand, the secretive side of the sign may sometimes develop as mysticism or some profound interest in secret societies (particularly, of course, when Mercury is in the twelfth house) or in hidden and obscure matters of one sort or another. They have tremendous capacity for investigation and are quite ruthless in their methods. These qualities often cooperate to bring about success, and some of the most profound seekers into the mysteries of life have this position of Mercury.\n\nThis is exemplified in its highest and best form by William Blake, probably the most profound mystic that the English race has produced. The activity of mind and the love for secret subjects of thought are shown in the horoscope of Robert Louis Stevenson.\n\nGandhi and Nehru exemplify the militant, persistent spirit of the mind conferred by this position.\n\nAn example of the vigorous eloquence and keen critical instincts of this position manifesting in matters of less universal importance is given by John Bright, and of these same qualities in more intense form by Theodore Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. W. S. Gilbert, the greatest of the social satirists of the Victorian Age, has Mercury in this sign, conjunct cynical Saturn.\n\nSomething of the brilliancy and secretiveness, with a most unfortunate turn, not only for repartee, which made him enemies, but for obscure thoughts, which gave them their weapon against him, is shown in the nativity of Oscar Wilde.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011566,2,NULL,8217,'Mercury in Sagittarius',NULL,'# Mercury in Sagittarius\n\nIn considering Mercury in Sagittarius it should be remembered how brilliant and sudden is the effect of Sagittarius, but how lightning-like and transitory. The older astrologers, indeed, attributed even lightning rather to Aries, leaving only the rainbow for Sagittarius, as if the effect were not merely swift, but, to a certain degree, illusory. This, however, is only the case with a badly aspected Mercury. Too much importance should not be given to the fact that Mercury in this sign has always been considered in his detriment. For we have seen that this planet very easily becomes unbalanced and the Jupiterian influence of Sagittarius seems to act rather as the restraining hand of a father upon an impetuous and wayward child. Much, however, will always depend upon aspects.\n\nThe general qualities of this position are directness of thought and expression. People with Mercury thus placed usually speak without reflection&mdash;they tend to say whatever comes into their heads. They do not wound deliberately, like people with Mercury in Scorpio. It simply never occurs to them to think how their remarks may strike the hearer. The quality of their thoughts is similarly unripe. Their thoughts are like mushrooms or shooting stars. They are impatient; speak in haste and repent at leisure. They do not trouble to formulate a judgment, and what they say consequently partakes too often of the nature of the shallower form of epigram. This same absence of the reflective quality makes them extremely simple, honest and sincere (duplicity by its very nature involves the balancing of truth and falsehood) , and if these people lie, they only do so on the spur of the moment. A long continued course of deception is entirely out of their power. It would, too, be repugnant to their nature.\n\nAnother difficulty caused by this position is that the thoughts are disconnected, and, though the native may promise with sincerity, or conceive undertakings with earnestness, he often has not the patience enabling him to make good. What he thinks and says, however, is sometimes remarkably, one might almost say irrationally, right. He may speak like an oracle, and his intuition is often so extraordinarily acute that it more than replaces the general weaknesses of the faculties of memory and of ratiocination. Another characteristic trait conferred by this position is a habit of interruption. No sooner do these people hear anything than a thought strikes them and they have to say it without a moment&apos;s delay.\n\nThe discontinuous and flitterbat quality of this type of mind is very well shown by the anarchist Vaillant, every one of whose thoughts was probably right in its way, but who was totally incapable of weighing one thought against another and of striking a balance. An almost equally bad example is Marie Bashkirtseff, who totally failed to understand the universe into which she was born, owing to a similar defect. Her diary is full of brilliant, bitter, satirical things, all of which are perfectly true in themselves and yet totally false because they are not balanced against the weight of general experience.\n\nAnother bright, brilliant, but brief and unbalanced mind was that of Thomas Chatterton, whose genius, had it been accompanied by a mind capable of patient labor, might have placed him in the small first circle of English poets. The case of Dr. Zamenhof is a good illustration. In Esperanto, he invented a language which is eminently convenient and easy to learn and has all the other advantages that a language should have. It has only one defect, which is that it really is not a language at all and nobody seems to wish to speak it.\n\nTo show this quality of incapacity for reflection in its most complete absurdity, we need only recall the remark of Marie Antoinette, who had Mercury in this position, and who, being offered some exquisite pastry by the leading confectioner of Paris, exclaimed, &ldquo;The stupid people are always complaining that they can get no bread, but why do they not eat these delicious little cakes?&rdquo; Another monarch almost equally silly and unfortunate with this position is Charles I, the inconstancy of whose domestic policy cost him his throne and his life.\n\nFortunately, however, this position does not always result in such sparkling imbecility. We have three quite great people in the world of art and literature with this position, Sir David Wilkie, Alfred de Musset, and Rudyard Kipling. The limitation is nevertheless still visible. Both the French and the English writers excel in short stories and poems, but neither has written great novels. Similarly, Sir David Wilkie, admirable painter as he was, never attained to the sustained execution of a great canvas.\n\nThe greatest exception to all that has been said is Sir Isaac Newton, but here Mercury is in the third house, with a sextile of Venus and a square of Saturn. Jupiter, lord of the third, is within six degrees of the conjunction of Saturn, and is exactly trined by Uranus, while the Sun, also in the third house, stands sextile to all three. The whole configuration is of the most extraordinary power, with every planet in heaven which tends to stability included in it, even Mars in Taurus assisting by making a near sextile with the Moon. With such great dignities the influence of the sign itself is reduced to a minimum. The fact that the Lord of the sign is in conjunction with Saturn tends to alter its very nature, and there is therefore no comparison with ordinary cases, where the action of Mercury is more or less isolated. In the horoscope of Marie Antoinette, Mercury is trine to Neptune, but square to Uranus which takes away all its more serious qualities. There is slight help from a wide sextile of Jupiter, but as has been well said, Mercury without Saturn is like an egg without salt.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011567,2,NULL,8473,'Mercury in Capricorn',NULL,'# Mercury in Capricorn\n\nIn Capricorn the admirable influence of Saturn upon Mercury is emphasized by the influence of Saturn&apos;s sign. Capricorn lends to Mercury the utmost gravity, dignity, steadfastness, earnestness, comprehensiveness, and power. The memory is usually splendid and the power of concentration is no less good than that of attention to detail. Sometimes these qualities may be over-emphasized. There is now and again a tendency to the lack of a sense of humor, and sometimes this operates as a serious defect. This is particularly true when the environment of the mind is unsuited to this disposition. People with Mercury in Capricorn may sometimes be a little like the skeleton at the feast. They are apt to be bores&mdash;they are incapable of frivolity, even at a picnic, and they are likely to be annoyed without cause at what they may think is the shallowness of other people, though sometimes those people may merely be laughing at their misplaced seriousness. In youth, this position of Mercury gives what is called an &ldquo;old head on young shoulders.&rdquo; There is some disposition to sullenness or sulking. The child seems to be rapt in its own thought; very likely it prefers solitude and does not care for play.\n\nThe mind is careful to examine closely any facts which may be presented to it, and it is inclined to suspicion, especially to the suspicion that other people are laughing at it. There is a very strong sense of causality and the reasoning powers generally are admirable. There is no tendency for the mind to waver, but it sometimes shifts violently from one idea to another or from one mood to another. There is very little real joyousness in the mind and the native is often the subject of quite unreasonable fear and liable to fits of depression which may end by endangering the reason. There being so much already of Saturn in the character of the sign itself, aspects of Saturn are sometimes to be feared, as likely to overwhelm altogether the natural elasticity. The unfriendly influence of Neptune and Uranus and even of Mars is equally dangerous. Conjunctions of the Sun may, however, be relied upon largely to counteract any such tendency.\n\nIt is very necessary for people with this position of Mercury to cultivate optimism. Good aspects of Venus are decidedly useful in making this possible. If they fail to conceal the general gravity of their disposition, they may find themselves unpopular with the majority of people. They should also be careful to avoid the expression of the often sardonic thought which is one of their characteristics, and they should not give utterance to the rebuke which is very ready on their tongue. These people are very censorious, stern and intolerant. Unless Mercury is well-aspected, they do not make sufficient allowance for the idiosyncrasies of other people.\n\nThis type of mind is to be distinguished carefully from the critical type, such as we saw in Scorpio. Mercury in Capricorn is not at all critical&mdash;its aggressiveness is of a totally different character. The native always knows that he is right and nothing can persuade him of the contrary or even make him listen to arguments. Very often this temperament is associated with extremely narrow views of religion, and the fixity of the mind may not infrequently seem grossly tyrannical to those associated with the native. The attitude is very much that of the schoolmaster. Whenever such people are &ldquo;dressed in a little brief authority,&rdquo; they are likely to become even more tyrannical than before. The position also develops an extreme degree of diplomacy which in many cases renders the native very clever in gaining his ends.\n\nIn the best cases, those in which the general horoscope indicates the possibilities of real greatness, the bad side of these qualities does not develop in such petty manner, and we have plenty of examples of really admirable characters with this position. In such cases, one must read only the nobler characteristics hitherto mentioned, and even these must be emphasized and expanded.\n\nThe position seems admirable for statesmen. The great protagonists of Victorian politics, Disraeli, and Gladstone, both had it. In Science we find this position in the nativities of Pasteur, Davy, Alfred Russell Wallace, and Havelock Ellis; while literature is represented by Lord Byron, Dickens, Lewis Carroll, Sainte Beuve, and Ruskin. It will be particularly noticed how excellently capable of laborious, steady constructiveness were all these minds. Even in the case of Lewis Carroll, it must not be forgotten that his real life was that of a mathematician of a very high order.\n\nThese people should all be compared and contrasted with the list given under Mercury in Sagittarius. Note the entire difference in the capacity for continuous construction. The more scholarly type of soldier, the organizing general is also represented in this position by General Gordon. Special attention should be paid to the integrity of this man&apos;s mind. Wilhelm II may also be mentioned as an example of a patient, laborious thinker, and in the less exalted, yet truly noble field, we have Sir Isaac Pitman. The task that he set himself recalls that of Dr. Zamenhof (inventor of Esperanto) previously mentioned under Sagittarius, and here again the contrast between the effect of the two signs is salient. Pitman was no visionary. Common sense was his long suit, and the results have been the practically universal adoption of his system of shorthand. By so far does patience exceed enthusiasm.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011568,2,NULL,8729,'Mercury in Aquarius',NULL,'# Mercury in Aquarius\n\nIn Aquarius we again find the influence of Saturn decidedly beneficial to Mercury. It is an even better position for the planet than Capricorn, since Aquarius is also air, and does not fix the mind in such stubbornness as the previous sign. We must also reflect upon the good influence of the sign itself. The mind of the native having this position of Mercury tends naturally to science and humanitarianism. Its interests are not so earth-bound and selfish. There is not quite the same faculty of steady application for this very reason. One must not expect any sign to combine all the virtues and exclude all the vices. But the faculty of concentration is admirable, and the mind is ingenious, resourceful, and logical, and that in a much better sense than we found with Capricorn. The logic of Capricorn is too rigid for application to practical affairs. It reigns supreme only in the exact sciences. The native loves truth for its own sake, but more in truth as a quality than in a mere collocation of facts. He understands Cardinal Newman&apos;s statement, &ldquo;As if &hellip; evidence were the test of truth!&rdquo;\n\nIt may be said here that there are two general types of minds among men, and this remark of Newman&apos;s is a very touchstone by which to recognize them. To one class, Newman&apos;s remark appears a triumphant refutation of academic precision and scholastic dullness. The other is absolutely bewildered by such a remark. He cannot conceive of any other test of truth than evidence. To him the sentence appears meaningless. And yet he may be subconsciously distressed by the mere existence of any man who can say such a thing. Now, we should not like to say definitely that Mercury in Aquarius would be violently partisan on either side. On the contrary, it is just these people who understand both positions and lean strongly to neither. The antithesis on this point would be Capricorn and Pisces&mdash;the former understanding nothing that could not be proved in Barbary, the other contemptuous of all such conventional sources of knowledge. This rule will be found practically invaluable.\n\nThe native with Mercury in Aquarius is a clever reasoner, but does not altogether disdain sophistry. He consequently makes a dangerous opponent in any argument, but he is amenable to reason and he often pronounces, for the sake of exercising his wits, propositions in which he does not seriously believe. He is usually a good judge of human nature, deriving his conclusions both from intuition and from experience. Where these conflict he is sometimes found at a loss.\n\nThe weak point of this sign is the absence of artistic impulse. Even where the power of visualization is great, its expression tends to be commonplace. Compare Swedenborg, who had this position, with Blake, whose Mercury was in Scorpio, the writings of both dealing with visions of a character decidedly similar. This sign gives a very pronounced tendency to investigations into the occult, but on lines much less mystical than we found in Scorpio. Besides Swedenborg, we have Proclus, Picus de Mirandola, and Swami Vivekananda. All these possessed immense learning, a strong power of vision, and were accurate observers and devoted students, but not one of them possessed the power of imagination in its highest sense.\n\nAs common as the capacity for research into these subtler matters of the soul is that for practical invention. In this connection one need only mention the name of Edison.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011569,2,NULL,8985,'Mercury in Pisces',NULL,'# Mercury in Pisces\n\nToo much emphasis has been laid by astrologers on the fact that Mercury is in his fall and detriment in Pisces. It is true that there is very little which can be called scientific about the mind of any native with this position. The sharp edge of the reason is usually wanting, and there is a disposition to a curious kind of mental idleness, which, however, is not really a defect. It merely means that the mind plunges itself into a bath of reflection, only to emerge purified and strengthened. However, this type of mental operation is not at all understandable by the devotees of reason, pure and simple. Those people who boast that their brains are always clear and active and who measure their achievements by the amount of visible work which they put into them cannot understand such individuals as we are now discussing. One might go further and say that they do not understand the laws under which the creative instinct works, or even the ordinary laws of generation and growth, either in the vegetable or animal kingdom.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the minds of those born with Mercury in Pisces possess one very contradictory pair of qualities. They are intensely practical in matters of thought, and tend to accept the pragmatic philosophy; they may even be utilitarians or hedonists. At the same time, they set a high value upon the conclusions of theoretical reasoning; but it does not follow from this that they will act on these conclusions. There is a fund of strong common sense in their nature and, when it comes to the test, they will follow instinct in preference to reason. In its manifestation, the mental power is far from stable. There may be periods when the mind seems almost dormant. In reality, what is happening is that the subconsciousness has taken hold and wishes to operate without interference from the more active portions of the mind. The memory is extremely retentive and the power of reflection enormous. But there is always this psychic quality in their mental processes. They make statements, ex cathedra, for which they cannot give chapter and verse. They know, but they do not know how they know. To people of different types of mind this often gives the idea that their knowledge is unreliable, but experience proves that this is not the case.\n\nTheir conversation, as a general rule, is fluent and subtle, but they are decidedly dependent on their environment, and, if their society is uncongenial, they keep silent. Sometimes this trait is very exaggerated; acute dislike founded upon no tangible reason throws them into a sullen mood, from which it is almost impossible to extricate them. Whenever they find themselves in harmonious surroundings, the fault will be in the other direction. They will talk too much, and, if undeveloped, are rather inclined to be talebearers and revealers of secrets. This is not because of any malice in the disposition, but because they are incapable of appreciating the amount of mischief that an unguarded word may cause. The psychic character of Pisces causes this sign to react upon the mind when Mercury is placed therein, not only by making it sensitive to subtle influences, but also by exposing it to all the disorders which they are apt to cause unless carefully balanced by strong common sense. The mind is not robust and vigorous in the way that we find when Mercury is in a more positive and virile sign. The forces which stir it have a different kind of strength. It is the rapier, not the broadsword. The result is that heavy and long continued strain upon the mind brings about nervous-break-downs in a way which could never happen with a person whose Mercury was in Aries or Virgo.\n\nPisces being ruled by Neptune, and Venus being exalted therein, and there being much sympathy both with Neptune and the Moon, it is natural that the artistic temperament should find a very full development in the mind. The tendency is to be romantic, perhaps, but this is not incompatible with extraordinary achievement. Naturally, in many cases, perhaps in most, the Sun will also be in Pisces, accentuating and steadying this disposition. One of the greatest romantic artists that ever lived, Victor Hugo, has this position of Mercury. Charles Baudelaire brings out more fully the intenser, more psychic, and less flamboyant qualities. Where Mercury refers to voice rather than thought, we have Adelina Patti, on the cusp of Aquarius and Pisces. Here the quality of Mercury is adapted to the physical organs of speech. The romantic, subtle, and rather shy and retiring temperament of mind is shown by Dr. Rudolph Steiner, who, engaged as he was, in a work of world-wide importance, yet managed to remain quietly and modestly in retirement, neither seeking fame nor troubling himself about advertisement.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011582,2,NULL,9241,'Venus in Aries',NULL,'# Venus in Aries\n\nVenus in this sign is in her fall, and the position is not fortunate, on the whole. There is evidence of the action of Mars in a certain rash impulsiveness in emotion, but the effect is rarely lasting or deep even at the moment. There is a strong tendency to be what the French call cerebral, and also to what is really coldness, though it may manifest itself in fiery sparks.\n\nIt is only necessary to study the writings of Baudelaire and Swinburne, to see the attitude taken towards love and art by both of them, to understand this position of Venus. There is fierceness and glitter, but it is the fire of the lightning rather than that of the hearth. Among women we see the same quality&mdash;modified in certain ways&mdash;in Mme. Steinheil and Queen Victoria. The former example needs no comment; the latter does. Victoria appeared a most domesticated person, but she was not; it was merely part of her ambitious policy to appear so.\n\nIn music one sees this fitful brilliancy of Venus represented by Tchaikovsky, and in literature by Bulwer-Lytton. The domestic affairs of the latter are well known, too well known, and show in life what he also expressed in his novels.\n\nThe tendency to lack stability is also manifest in Robespierre. The trouble seems to be not that there is any lack of activity in Venus when she is in this sign, but that that activity is ill-directed. She is not really fickle, but appears to be so because of her idealism. Reality failing to respond to her mental conception, she becomes discontented. At the same time, it must be understood that no fulfillment of her desires, however nearly perfect, would satisfy her. It is in the contemplation of her wishes that she finds pleasure rather than in the enjoyment of them. She is extraordinarily imaginative; the merest hint excites her. She loves by sight, but touch disappoints her. When a person with this position of Venus discovers that Shelley quarreled with his wife or that Browning smoked a pipe or that Matthew Arnold wore whiskers, disappointment and disillusion follow. The poetry is spoiled for them, because it is not written by a creature who not only does not, and did not, but never could exist.\n\nA remarkable example of the idealism of this position is afforded us by Abraham Lincoln, whose Venus trined Neptune on the Midheaven. This is an unsurpassable position for unfaltering devotion to an ideal. Lincoln was as conscious as any other man, as prescient as any seer could possibly have been, of what it meant in immediate agony to humanity to call for volunteers, as he did on that dramatic day which changed the whole history of these States. But his high purpose was not overwhelmed by his great sympathy for the temporary sufferings of humanity. To him, right was right, and must be supported, no matter what the cost. Had Neptune been in Capricorn, and Venus in Taurus, instead of in Sagittarius and Aries respectively, he would have thought far more of the material miseries which immediately threatened his country, and secession might have become an accomplished fact. It was his idealism which not only prevented the disruption of the Union, but implanted as a principle, which will never cease to be paramount in this country, to do the right thing no matter what the cost. One can readily understand how this attitude may be misinterpreted by the other party as lack of sympathy.\n\nVenus in this sign is extraordinarily brilliant; she is the beauty of the sparks which are struck from the sword of Mars as he goes into battle, but she is robbed of all the importance which she has as tenderness and graciousness. She becomes the Amazon, panoplied and splendid, with no trace of the Hausfrau. She is hard, brilliant, subtle, passionate, but not enduring and not inclined to please. She attacks and she repels, but all her operations are operations of assault and battery. She stirs to activity and quits. In women, this position is exceptionally unpleasant. She may be extraordinarily attractive but, even if she gratifies, will never satisfy. She excites and irritates, never calms and soothes. Even in art, one perceives clearly how unsatisfactory, from the point of view of Venus herself, so to speak, is this position for her. When Swinburne wrote &ldquo;Dolores,&rdquo; he was trying to paint a picture of Venus in Libra or in Scorpio; he only succeeded in painting a Venus in Aries type.\n\nWe see the same thing in the writing of Baudelaire and the music of Tchaikovsky. It is always irritation without satisfaction; it is not Isis veiled, but Isis in armor. As indicated above, this position is very much better for men than it is for women, but it is good even for them only where Venus is a subsidiary figure, not only in the horoscope itself, but in the general character of the native. Where his general pursuit in life is of the character of Venus, it is bad, but it is not bad for such men as Lincoln and J. P. Morgan to have Venus under arms.\n\nIt may be of great value in the horoscope of any man of the more studious and serious sort not to have Venus flower too fully. We find her in this position in the horoscopes of such men as Emerson, Alexander Graham Bell and the Hon. Stephen A. Douglas. Where, however, the native is an artist, the limitations may be regarded as troublesome. Thus we find comic illustrator Palmer Cox in art and Frank R. Stockton in literature somewhat lacking in the graciousness and floridity that seem appropriate to the artistic temperament. Occasionally, the effect of Venus in Aries is very bad indeed, implying heartlessness, and this will particularly apply when the general temperament is already mercurial. We class the position as a decided restriction upon Venus. She always fails to attain her full development, and whether this be good or bad for the native, in a general way, must depend upon considerations entirely foreign to her. It is evident, for example, that a great soldier will not be benefited by having Venus of equal importance with Mars, or a great man of science by having her stronger than Uranus, Saturn and Mercury. Consideration, such as the foregoing, must always be taken into account, in estimating the real value to the native of any particular position of any particular planet. Each description must be regarded as an isolated statement, merely one pawn in a complex position of many pieces.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011583,2,NULL,9497,'Venus in Taurus',NULL,'# Venus in Taurus\n\nVenus in Taurus is in her own house and is therefore very strong; but the earthy quality of the sign has two effects which seem at first sight curiously incompatible. The action is drawn down to the physical plane -- we shall find but rare examples of &ldquo;ideal love&rdquo; or &ldquo;platonic affection&rdquo; in people with this position -- but also it is slow to start. People with Venus so placed, though they have enormous capacity for love, do not develop on the sex-plane until long after the average. Once the blossom flowers, it flowers magnificently. All the tenacity of the bull comes into play, and every hope may be entertained of settled happiness.\n\nAt all times, however, the magnetism of the sign is manifest, and people with this position often present baffling mysteries to their admirers. They give all the physical signs of great passion and are perfectly aware of how well they are fitted both to inspire and to reciprocate devotion; yet they will not yield themselves until the right person arrives. When that happens, the surrender is often instant and the fidelity eternal.\n\nThe same characteristics, transmuted to other planes, obtain there. There is often great amiability, though tact is rarely fine. Fortune in small matters is steady, but not sudden or capricious; and the artistic side of the native is likely to be solid, sensible, and free from erratic and hysterical manifestations. The word &ldquo;domesticity,&rdquo; if it be extended to cover all the many qualities combined in Venus, gives a good idea of what is meant.\n\nTaurus is preeminently the sign of material form and tends to bring everything to operation on the physical plane. The sex instinct, when Venus is in this sign, is consequently very simple and natural, as direct and intelligible as the marriage service in the Church of England prayer-book. Selection is determined primarily by physical fitness; other considerations hardly apply. The native is particularly fond of comfort, and strives actively and persistently to create this in his environment. While the sex instinct is direct and, as it were, plainly spoken, it in no way violates delicacy. The absence of shame is in itself a guarantee of modesty. Gentleness and kindliness go naturally with this position and contribute to the increase of its magnetism. Sense of sex, although somewhat animal, is perfectly clean and normal. There is no tendency to its perversion or degeneration, unless Venus should be afflicted by Saturn, or Uranus, or Neptune.\n\nApart from actual sex relations, this position means a great deal of geniality in the temperament, which very often stands for great popularity. Other people are naturally sympathetic to this type. Much of the success of such people as Joseph Pulitzer, W. J. Bryan, W. T. Stead, Levi P. Morton, Chauncey M. Depew, and Marconi may be attributed to this position. In art, we see Daniel Chester French, whose sculptures show a massive, majestic and somewhat florid style. Sometimes the sympathy becomes more nearly universal yet, embracing all nature, as we see in such people as Walt Whitman and Luther Burbank. The extraordinary feeling of the unity of nature possessed by both these men caused them to be looked upon at first with disfavor by their contemporaries, and as if there were something eccentric in their outlook; but a better understanding has shown this to be the very quintessence of sanity. It is not just, therefore, to speak of such ideas as unconventional. However, that in them which was original is not to be attributed to the position of Venus. Whitman, for example, has Neptune and Uranus in conjunction, square to Saturn and Pluto, an admirable configuration for epoch-making force. Unless there is something of this sort, one must not look to this position for originality, even of presentation.\n\nOne may cite the point of view of Thomas Hardy and Thomas Moore in literature, or even that of Alphonse Daudet. There is a certain conventionality in the outlook which prevents extravagances, even those of genius. The sanity and glow of Turner may be ascribed to this position of Venus. Wagner illustrates it even better; and the steady correctness of Backhaus as a pianist is very much in keeping. Wagner&apos;s Venus is, however, rendered singularly brilliant by the conjunction of Sol within one degree. W. B. Yeats is rather a difficult case. His Venus qualities are decidedly nebulous and airy (astrologers now know that Yeats was born with the outer planet Pluto within 17 minutes of 4).\n\nWith ordinary people&mdash;not artists&mdash;the effect is clear enough. We have such sincere and sober folk as George V, Bismarck, Cromwell, Alexander II and Lord Wolseley. The domestic affairs of these people never gave cause for anxiety!','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011584,2,NULL,9753,'Venus in Gemini',NULL,'# Venus in Gemini\n\nGemini has the precisely opposite effect to Taurus. In this sign Venus is easily aroused, but has little or nothing physical or positive about it. It is inconstant, and always mental or ideal. People having this position of Venus are constitutionally and congenitally incapable of understanding passion as ordinary men and women do. In the case of Shakespeare, for example, he is a master of Neptunian love (Venus and Neptune are conjoined in his horoscope), as shown in &ldquo;As You Like it&rdquo; and &ldquo;Twelfth Night&rdquo; and &ldquo;Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream,&rdquo; rather than of the ordinary passion between man and wife.\n\nIn Petrarch we have a somewhat warmer Venus, but the love is still ideal and therefore incomprehensible to the average man. One must be a poet to read Petrarch with pleasure.\n\nWhere science is already elsewhere indicated as the pursuit in life, this position in Gemini comes naturally to strengthen that disposition, or at least to avoid weakening it by a counter-pull. Thus Kant, Huxley, and Herbert Spencer were undisturbed in their life&apos;s work by the claims of love or pleasure, and all their Venus-quality was manifested on the mental plane.\n\nPeople with this position are never quite satisfied. &ldquo;Ah but a man&apos;s reach should exceed his grasp; or what&apos;s a heaven for?&rdquo; is a Browning quotation which they import into private life. They are often frivolous, fickle, and incapable of any but the most superficial affection. Nor is the object of affection ever single; such people are often terribly puzzled as to which of several admirers to prefer. In truth, they want none of them; they like the titillation, and would be seriously annoyed if one of their pigeons turned out a hawk as sometimes happens!\n\nThe intellectuality of Gemini often enables the native to understand passion, even though he does not feel it. The examples of Shakespeare and Petrarch given above are to the point. The difficulty comes in the power of expression, for though, as Oscar Wilde observed, &ldquo;genuine emotion is the root of all bad art,&rdquo; yet it is also the root of all good art, and its absence renders the portrayal of human character to some degree unsatisfying. In America we have an extremely satisfactory example of the attitude which we are discussing. It is that of Elbert Hubbard. He regarded the mind, or rather the mental plane, as the most real and the only important one of the planes, and his whole doctrine, being based on this assumption, finds both its strength and weakness therein. Some writer has asserted that all phenomena are but phantoms of the mind, and much of the teaching of Elbert Hubbard was very similar in this underlying assumption. This attitude is, of course, very distasteful to the average man, who regards it as evidence alike of lack of feeling and of instability of brain. The distinction between these points of view touches the emotions so closely that ill-feeling is bound to exist between people who happen to be on opposite sides of the fence. Without presuming to take sides in so embittered a controversy, or to give judgment in so delicate a dispute, one is bound to say that Gemini may be regarded as by no means sympathetic to Venus. Her presence in that sign is a limitation, for her nature is earth and water, while Gemini is pure air, and there is bitter hostility between air and earth. The effect of air upon Venus makes her dispersed and frivolous, which is a vice of Venus, whose excellence consists in form, in plasticity, in repose.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011585,2,NULL,10009,'Venus in Cancer',NULL,'# Venus in Cancer\n\nOne might generalize the effect of the elemental attribution of the signs upon Venus by calling fire passionate, earth affectionate, air ideal or romantic, and water voluptuous. The passivity of Cancer certainly makes Venus extremely emotional. It is hard for a person with this position to resist the advances of another; at the same time, the lunar force in Cancer makes the nature changeable. There is little disposition to seek companionship or love, but, when these are offered, they are gladly accepted. There is often deep sentimentality, and the native is apt to take his affairs too seriously; in reality, wounds heal quickly. It is very unfortunate for any native with this position to be deprived of free normal expression of his or her tendencies; in such cases the health may suffer.\n\nThis sign is in many ways the most suitable of all for Venus; she seems to dissolve into a swoon therein. However, the tendency is to sensuality in a very marked degree, though not so much so as we shall find when we come to Scorpio. It is desirable to find some aspect with a tendency to correct any exaggeration of this quality.\n\nThe desire for comfort in life and general good fortune in minor matters is to be expected in natives with Venus in Cancer. In art and music, and in literature also, the effect appears to be very intense; the feelings are very quiet and deep-seated, permeating the whole atmosphere. This quality will be recognized in the work of Dante Alighieri, Balzac, and Schumann. The peculiar pathos and melancholy of the last-mentioned is, of course, due to the conjunction of the Lord of the Ascendant, Saturn, with Neptune. In all these determinations it must constantly be remembered that one practically never finds any single uncomplicated aspect; and crude, superficial research is consequently bound to be misleading.\n\nA good example of the quiet sentimentality of the configuration is given by Abbas Effendi, who sought to build up a religion on generalities of a purely pacific and amiable type.\n\nFranz Josef II, Nicholas II, and Maximilian of Mexico all had this position; the effect is recognizable in the softness and ductility of their characters. In the last case, this became actual weakness and contributed largely to his ruin.\n\nWe have however three very remarkable cases of a quite opposite tendency. Sometimes Cancer appears to remember quite suddenly that it is a cardinal sign with Jupiter exalted, and to act accordingly! Even in the types of face given when it is rising, we see these two contrasted, the round, flat, pale moon-like face for one, and the aquiline, red, dominant, aggressive, hatchet-profile for the other.\n\nJay Gould certainly possessed none of the characteristics which we have cited, but his Venus is conjoined with Jupiter, and squared by the conjunction of Luna and Saturn. This is sufficient to determine the sign to activity.\n\nEntrepreneur and statesman Cecil Rhodes had very little of the true Cancer effect on Venus; but here again Saturn interferes, via a nice sextile from Taurus.\n\nAnother example is Napoleon Bonaparte. Here Venus in Cancer, sextile to Uranus, Neptune, and Mars, accounts for his easy amours, and that indulgence in the pleasures of the table which led to his death. His general method, too, was quite in keeping with this position. It is his actions as a soldier and a statesman which make us think at first of him as an unlikely person to have this position. But such actions hardly come under Venus at all; they are only indirectly influenced by her in the same way as hip-disease might interfere with oratory by limiting the use of gestures; and we may therefore call the very particular attention of the student to this case as highly and aptly illustrative of the effect.\n\nThere are, however, many manifestations of Venus besides the obvious one. In Cancer, she frequently gives humorous good-nature a gentle and ingratiating method which endears the observer to the native without his quite knowing why it should be so. An excellent illustration of this quality is Oliver Wendell Holmes, and on the stage we see it in Harry Lauder.\n\nCancer always makes for popularity, because it is ruled by the Moon, and the presence of Venus in the sign should cause the native to be generally beloved. Napoleon, of course, owed his elevation to the hold which he had upon the affections of the people, and it was no doubt the personal popularity of Franz Josef II, more than anything else, which enabled him to harmonize and build up the nations which he ruled, into one great empire. Their dissensions always stopped short of the person of the emperor, and many a time they were restrained from going to extremes, only by considerations of him. Cecil Rhodes, again, is a figure who struck the popular imagination. So, to turn once more to our own country, did preacher Henry Ward Beecher. Here there is no question of the popularity, and it is also possible that certain other facts which made considerable stir at the time may partially, at least, be attributed to this position.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Venus in Leo is not so passionate as in Aries, but she is loyal and warm-hearted. She becomes capable even of that highest virtue of self-sacrifice without which all is in vain. She becomes that Charity of which the apostle Paul waxed eloquent. This, however, depends as usual upon aspects; an attack of Saturn (for example) may undo all the good and transform it into evil; yet this is not so easily accomplished as when she is in a more passive and sensitive sign. However fallen, she always retains some memory of her ancient dignity.\n\nThus we find many of the greatest-hearted people born with this position. In recent times we have Colonel Olcott, one of the kindest-hearted men that ever lived, Tolstoi, George Sand, and Maurice Maeterlinck. One will note the flavor of humanitarianism in its best sense in all these.\n\nIt is to be observed, with some care, that three of the most popular British statesmen of the generation just passed&mdash;Balfour, Chamberlain, and Asquith, all have this position. They were of very different types, yet all acquired popularity in a way that hardly any others have done. Their positive qualities are in each case ill-fitted to inspire affection; it is something deeper in their natures which has attracted the love of their fellow countrymen.\n\nIn the middle ages, who stands more for the ripe, kindly spirit of generous love than Cornelius Agrippa? It is not openly apparent in his writing, but it gilds the whole.\n\nThe same remark, with necessary modification, applies to Bernard Shaw. Venus in Leo is not self-assertive and blatant; it lurks hidden, its abiding glow warming the hands of life, but never scorching them.\n\nThere is no better position for Venus to attract warm feeling on the part of others; even where respect is not given to the native, he yet acquires sympathy and kindly consideration, because he is such a good fellow. The geniality of former President Taft was very characteristic. His bitterest political opponents never said a word against him personally. Another very good example is Irvin Cobb; Venus in Leo is very well characterized by his kindly, humanitarian humor and also by his personal characteristics. In a wider way, a more serious way, we see the same quality in pacifist Jane Addams; and the graciousness and good feeling of Dr. Felix Adler are almost equally well known.\n\nTo return to the by-paths of history, we may cite the great-hearted and magnanimous Garibaldi, as illustrative of this position, while its nobility and good-feeling were also very clearly manifest in the character of Cardinal Richelieu. Curiously enough, his successor, Mazarin, has the same position, but in Mazarin, these qualities were by no means strongly marked. A glance at his nativity explains why&mdash;Mercury is in conjunction with Venus, masking her warmth by his rational and calculating acumen, and she is seriously afflicted by a square of Uranus on the one side, and of Saturn on the other. The position of Saturn, which dominates the horoscope from the Midheaven, emphasizes the selfishness of the native, and Uranus, being in bad aspect to Venus, hinders the emancipation and breadth which a friendly aspect might have restored to her. These aspects might not have been sufficient to destroy her influence, had not Saturn been so extremely powerful in the horoscope. Not only is he in the Midheaven, but Lord of the Ascendant. Saturn is, therefore, the key of the complex, and is sufficiently powerful to out-weigh the influence of Leo upon Venus.\n\nNature presents itself to people with Venus in Leo as primarily an emotional phenomenon. There is not the materialism which we found in Taurus or the intellectualism given by her presence in Gemini. The native may acquiesce in the dictum of Schopenhauer, that the world is a reflection of will and that both the material and mental aspects of it are subsidiary.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011587,2,NULL,10521,'Venus in Virgo',NULL,'# Venus in Virgo\n\nThe cold and earthy and mercurial nature of Virgo may be described as the very opposite to that of Venus. The planet, too, is in her fall and never develops properly. She may make a woman a careful housewife and a good hostess&mdash;for Virgo distributes the affections, forbids friendships but encourages acquaintanceships&mdash;but never a loving wife or a passionate mistress, unless there are some remarkably warm aspects to intensify her nature. Women of the town, many of whom are incapable of true feeling of any kind, often have this position. The native, too, is usually fastidious about people. Others are inclined to consider him cold, heartless and repellent. On the other hand, the sang-froid and aplomb which his indifference gives often make him a favorite on the lecture platform or the stage.\n\nA very good example of its peculiar manifestation in art is the influential painter Millet, whose paintings of peasants&apos; daily lives display naturalism and realism. The perception is extraordinarily keen and accurate.\n\nWe find little development of the emotional nature in this position. Some of the most notoriously cold and even callous people in history have possessed it. However, it does not always turn to evil, and, in many cases, the position is a decided advantage in life. For example, one may attribute much of Anna Kingsford&apos;s high mentality to this cause. Her more tender feelings were distributed through intellectual channels. We find a similar case in prison reformer Thomas Mott Osborne, and these two examples may be considered the very flower of this position. The same development of emotion on humanitarian rather than on personal lines is clearly marked in Samuel Taylor Coleridge, but here it is noticeable how Virgo works upon Venus in courting the native to be, or at least to seem, cold, and to hold himself aloof, if not exactly from the society of his fellows, at least from any close intimacy with them. Similar qualities are observable in the horoscopes of President Hayes, President Carnot, President Kruger, Cardinal Gibbons, and Edward VI of England. In none of these can the position be described as having worked unfavorably. With Ludwig of Bavaria, however, the theatrical tendency is seen in an exaggerated form. He may be said rather to have acted his life than to have lived it. In Ludwig&apos;s chart, Venus conjunct Mercury in late Virgo is the focus of a tight Yod pattern involving Neptune and Pluto. However, there are worse cases. In Caesar Borgia, this position produced downright callousness. This is, no doubt, emphasized by the shutting up of Venus in the twelfth house, her aspect to Saturn conjunct Mars in the eleventh, and the fact that Virgo is actually the rising sign. It may seem at first sight surprising that Goethe, Dumas, and Guy de Maupassant should have this position, but further investigation clears up the difficulty. Goethe&apos;s Venus has the sextiles of Neptune and Pluto and the opposition of Jupiter and also the semi-sextile of Mercury, and Venus is powerfully placed in the tenth house. Dumas has the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, the semi-sextile of Sol and that of Uranus. De Maupassant has Mercury semi-sextile, Mars and Jupiter in conjunction. Such aspects from such great planets overpower the isolated influence of the sign, to a very large extent. It can still be traced, but only in minor matters.\n\nThis position of Venus does not exactly lack magnetism, but it is a different kind of magnetism from that which is usually understood by that word. James Coates, the mesmerist, had Venus in Virgo&mdash;the focus of a Yod from the Moon and Uranus. The quality that enables a man to hypnotize successfully is very different from that which makes him a great lover. The position is admirable for a lawyer, giving him the power of insinuating his ideas into the minds of his hearers. Many very attractive speakers have this same position. People with Venus so situated have the power to express emotion without really feeling it. They can weep very convincingly for &ldquo;Hecuba.&rdquo;\n\nThe position is also admirable for a nurse, where the greatest care and tenderness are required, yet where any trace of true pity or emotion would diminish the efficiency.\n\nHowever, while not wishing to say anything derogatory to the natives who have this position, we must say that, so far as the development of Venus is concerned, it is not her highest development. It is a decided modification of her qualities and a limitation of her powers. It is, however, not to be regarded as so thoroughgoing an affliction as when she is in Aries.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

The only drawback to her excellence comes from the airy nature of the sign, which, conflicting with her earthy disposition, tends to diminish her domesticity. It is also important to note that Saturn is exalted in Libra, and in dealing with the aspects of Saturn and Venus it is shown how generally sinister is his effect upon her. In this sign, the Venus quality tends to be mysterious and bizarre, and suffers dark and inexplicable perversions. The ordinary bourgeois is usually very afraid of people having her in this position. She is too fine and subtle for the average man. The amatory side of Venus is not obvious; the feeling is refined into aestheticism. People with this position, however, often possess sincere affection, but it is important to express such affection more on the mental and spiritual planes than on others. The limitations of marriage are keenly felt. On the artistic side this is the best sign for Venus. She gives a magnificent sense of proportion, harmony and color, which can amount to genius, as displayed by Julia Marlowe, the popular Shakespearean actress. Vulgarity and blatancy are very distasteful, and uncongenial surroundings cause extreme unhappiness, and upset the nervous system. With all this there is a great love of simplicity in art. The Egyptian, Grecian and Chinese styles are preferred to the flamboyant and rococo.\n\nThus we see that, when Venus is in Libra, love is nearly always more and less than love, as understood by the average man. It is, to some extent, a religion, possessing its own ritual. Where disappointment occurs, the feeling is not that of a wounded heart, but rather as if a blasphemy had been uttered, or a crime against God committed. At times, the religious feeling in connection with this matter amounts almost to fetishism. This attitude often causes the native to dread the commonplace exceedingly, and, endeavoring to avoid that Scylla, he may be devoured by the Charybdis of the abnormal. Perversity of one sort or another is consequently common. This may not be actual vice&mdash;it results from refinement, delicacy and imagination.\n\nVenus in this sign is released from earthy bondage. She takes wings and flies. She dwells in realms of air and the worst torture which she can suffer is her enchainment by bodily expression or material condition. Not only is a marriage of convenience impossible to her, but even true love may be revolting as soon as it takes physical form. It is in some ways not altogether fortunate that so important a branch of life should be thus divorced from what Nature evidently intended as its limitation. Love was originally intended as a mere physical appetite. Its exaltation as amorism, romanticism, mysticism, aestheticism and the rest are superstructed, built upon that basis by the idealism of the Great Architect and His fellow-builders on the aspiring human plane.\n\nThe reader must not forget that Saturn is exalted in Libra, and, for this reason, there is much melancholy in the sign, which therefore transforms Venus from her simplicity, frankness and laughter into a subtle, secret, and somewhat austere Goddess, to be worshipped in secret shrines, rather than in the meadows. She is not content with offerings of flowers; she demands human sacrifice. Of course, this is only a description of the action of this position on a single plane. The escape from flesh may be into many different fallacies. The effect of air, to which element Libra belongs, connects it with intellectuality; not only is it the ideal which is adored, even on the material plane, but the ideal frequently roots itself in devotion to causes of a religious, artistic or humanitarian character. In this connection we may mention the names of St. Augustine, Madame Blavatsky, Georgia O&apos;Keeffe, Frances Willard and Elizabeth Stanton.\n\nWe have more characteristic examples still in Edward VII, and Queen Elizabeth I. Here the influence of Libra as the judicial sign is very evident. These two monarchs were unquestionably the greatest diplomatists that ever occupied the throne of England. One sees a similar subtlety in Annie Besant. The position has a more obviously physical influence in the careers of Cleo de Merode and Oscar Wilde. But the most powerful illustration of its aesthetic perfectionism is afforded by T.S. Eliot. Here Venus and Mercury are rising on the Libra Ascendant.\n\nVenus is not sufficiently big to bear the whole weight of destiny. No amount of support can make her anything but yielding. Even in the most favorable cases, therefore, there is an element of possible disaster. Sooner or later, the clay pot bumps against the brass pot and is smashed. Louis XVI is a particularly striking instance, with Venus trine the Midheaven and sextile Neptune. All his tact and sympathy failed to meet the situation which confronted him.\n\nThose born with Venus in Libra are extremely careful about their surroundings. Harmony and beauty are as necessary to them as the air they breathe. They are much more particular about the manners of their friends than about their moral standards. They possess great personal dignity and a certain seriousness of attitude toward life which makes them almost pontifical. They possess charm, tact, a gravely sympathetic manner and much real kindness of heart. But they never allow this to degenerate into geniality. They dislike familiarity and do not allow anyone to take liberties with them.\n\nThere is a certain gaiety in the disposition, but it is kept below the surface. Frederick MacMonnies had a stellium with Venus in Libra and his famous &ldquo;Bacchante&rdquo; might almost do for an astrological picture of this position at its brightest. There is always the feeling of the dance in Libra, but it is not the vulgar dance which is a mere expression of animal spirits. These exist, and exist strongly, but they are veiled by the religious instinct. The dance is, therefore, a religious dance, a subtle and esoteric ritual &ldquo;inscrutable to the profane.&rdquo; In its highest expression, therefore, this position of Libra becomes almost divine. The perversities which have already been described may be considered as the trials of a pilgrim. At the end of the journey is the palace of that truth and beauty which are one.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

It completely destroys any altruistic tendencies, and it may turn her amiability not only into sensuality but into something grosser still. Her influence is often extremely violent; passion is intense and physical; unless gratified it is likely to turn into hatred; and, even when it is reciprocated, its career is likely to be stormy, in particular afflictions it may end in treacheries and tragedies. People with this position run the greatest danger of getting themselves into social trouble. It is particularly important to guard against misalliance either with or without the assent of the law. The extreme violence of the feelings may also react ultimately upon the health; since, great as the capacity is, the desires are still stronger and may easily lead to dangerous excess.\n\nA disappointment also frequently arises from too great straightforwardness. Such people are likely to frighten the birds which they wish to ensnare. They are sometimes unscrupulous in the pursuit of their plans. No consideration seems to weigh with them. This naturally results in what may pass with the world for success, and unquestionably the physical magnetism is as great of its kind as in any other sign. In fact Libra alone rivals it. But the magnetism of Libra is subtle and perverse, whereas that of Scorpio is coarse and gross.\n\nIn dealing with the nativities of people who have lacked the refining influences of education, this position stands for quite animal dissipation and is nearly always associated with drunkenness. People of a higher type naturally escape such extremes. But frequently the cynical temperament develops as a result of satiety. This is marked in the cases of Sainte Beuve, Benjamin Disraeli, and Marie Antoinette. In the last case one may regard this position of Venus in her horoscope as one of the principal causes of the French Revolution. One has only to examine the innumerable pamphlets which were written against her to see how this came about.\n\nVenus in Scorpio does not appear compatible with any striking tendencies towards artistic development, and she is also here very weak in tact and amiability. In the case of Swiss-German artist Paul Klee she is inspired as part of a tight Mystic Rectangle with Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune&mdash;but until he met Kandinsky, his art consisted of black-and-white grotesques and satires. It must be remembered that in this sign she is in her detriment. Of course, the usual modifications caused by aspects are always to be considered, but the position is so sensual that it takes a great deal to overcome its natural tendencies.\n\nPeople with this position are extremely self-possessive in the matter of affection. Jealousy with them is a passion far more consuming than the love which has given birth to it. A trifling disappointment will turn love into hate&mdash;relentless and unscrupulous. The character of the passion is as physical as when Venus is in Taurus, but in the earthy sign, she connects with all the natural, genial, domestic, human qualities. Venus in Scorpio may be called almost demoniac; weary, but unsatisfied, is her motto. She never rests. Scorpio in many of its aspects is symbolized by the sea in storm, and the qualities of that element accurately symbolize this temperament.\n\nThe magnetism is extraordinarily strong, but may be called primitive. There is a kind of fascination which the innocent frequently fail to recognize, and which consequently makes them fall an easy prey. This type is curiously open to flattery. A compliment is always taken as surrender, as a tribute to the superiority of the native.\n\nVenus in Scorpio is extremely passionate and irresistible. It will not be content with anything but exact fulfillment of its desires. It is consequently necessary for the loved one to comply absolutely, or at least to seem to comply with sufficient skill to pretend; and this is, evidently, by no means a dignified or worthy position for anyone to maintain.\n\nIt must be borne in mind that, when Venus is in Scorpio, the Sun and Mercury may, at the same time, be in either Libra or Sagittarius; in such case, much that has been said would be largely modified, or the education and circumstances of the native would be such that the qualities imparted by the pure Venus in Scorpio would be latent and never be brought to the surface. They might be expressed through a feeling of great dissatisfaction and suppression.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011590,2,NULL,11289,'Venus in Sagittarius',NULL,'# Venus in Sagittarius\n\nVenus is in some ways at her best in this sign. She has not the passion which we have noticed in the other two fiery signs. She is more impulsive and less constant. The slightest rebuff kills the interest. And in no case is affection likely to be long-lived. These remarks apply to love rather than to friendship, for, in the latter, the fact that Jupiter rules Sagittarius comes into play.\n\nFor this reason we call Venus at her best; she has an aspiring and spiritual quality which tends to remove from her any taint of earthy grossness. This very quality, however, may in some eyes appear as a defect. Those who imagine that the only kind of love is that which is expressed in accordance with social conventions may be unmeasured in the hatred of such tendencies as this sign confers, particularly upon women.\n\nIt is very common to find fantastic passions such as have been celebrated by Baudelaire, Verlaine and Swinburne, as well as by the one supreme poetess that ever lived, Sappho. Those things which are gross and unrefined do not appeal. It is necessary to satisfy mental and spiritual cravings and also to content the imagination. The lack of earthiness, the absence of physical bonds, causes rapid changes which may be mistaken for caprice, but which are really not so; on the contrary, they are symptoms of fidelity to the ideal. People with this position are proud and high-spirited, and they demand the same qualities in those whom they love. Indelicacy shocks. Further it may be said that any attempt to bind down the affections is intensely resented. To fish for such people one must employ the finest lines and the smallest flies; though the more brightly they are colored, the more successful is likely to be the sport.\n\nExamples of the peculiar delicacy or spirit conferred by this position are afforded by George Eliot, Robert Louis Stevenson, Chatterton, and Lewis Carroll. Perhaps, too, the unfortunate relations of Charles I with his ministers may be attributed to this position. He never seemed able to trust constantly in them. He would trust too much, become disappointed for quite insufficient reasons, and then betray them. One might also look at the political careers of Gladstone, Winston Churchill and Theodore Roosevelt. The extraordinary rashness in speech of the last named is very typical of this position.\n\nWith most ordinary people, these qualities manifest as something not much better than heartlessness and fickleness. Love sparkles and glitters, but is without warmth. Venus does not expand sufficiently to glow or to ennoble the life with true affection. There is never any excess energy to waste. The native has just so much of the Venusian qualities as suits his own purpose. He has none to give to others. As the swift spark is very attractive to those who really seek love, people with Venus in this sign often cause the greatest disappointment&mdash;they attract the passion of really warm-hearted people and then fail to satisfy it. Often they cannot understand how they are failing. Similarly, they may cause much anxiety to those who love them because they do not reciprocate the affections of the other party, who may consequently believe that he is failing in kindness, when, in reality, it is merely that he is trying to rekindle a shooting star. Very often true passion is altogether lacking or, if it exists, it is as transient and ephemeral as we learn that certain brightly colored insects are.\n\nIt often happens that the natural instincts are replaced by fantasies, forms of love which are expressed by symbol rather than by sense. Hence, the natural purpose of Venus, which is, after all, vitally important to the race, is frequently thwarted. Venus in Sagittarius often induces the native to act in such ways as to avoid what is, after all, the one great glorious human attribute, willing sacrifice. Thus, a woman with Venus in Sagittarius might prefer to adopt a child rather than to go through the pains of bearing one.\n\nIn art, we find a very interesting expression of this position in Mark Twain (S.L. Clemens). Here we see an art, extraordinarily jeweled, with brief scintillations, but we rarely find in his writings the large, sustained humor, elaborated and rendered complex by the interplay of one idea with another, such as we find in the greatest masters. One may also recommend to the reader without comment, the study of three people very different in this position who are yet united by the presence of Venus in this sign: Marie Bashkirtseff, Maude Adams, and Evelyn Nesbit (Thaw).','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011591,2,NULL,11545,'Venus in Capricorn',NULL,'# Venus in Capricorn\n\nThis sign brings out the colder and more earthy side of Venus, and exercises a restricting influence, in many cases, upon the temperament. While it gives strong and permanent attachments, yet the nature may be called capricious. The native loves the comic or Panic side of intrigue; he is likely to be somewhat gross and even lustful in the expression of attachment; he will waste time, health and money in the search for pleasure; yet at the same time he will be extremely petty about it. There is little amiability. Indifference is the real interior attitude. And this is only modified by gusts of storm. The native is usually jealous and exacting. He expects too much of other people; but that not through optimism or idealism, but, on the contrary, from self-interest.\n\nPeople with Venus thus situated are usually very slow in developing the sexual instinct, and the later they marry the better their chances to make a success of it. Sometimes this tardiness is such that it never develops at all during the life time. This is often the case when other instincts happen to be tremendously powerful. We find many instances of people whose human side has failed to develop through the occupation of the mind with loftier ideals. We may notice the cases of Swedenborg, William Blake, and Swami Vivekananda, who were occupied primarily with mystic conceptions. In the case of the Indian sage Venus took her revenge, as she nearly always does when slighted, and that which might have been after all quite as holy as any amount of meditation expressed itself in ways which nearly led to open scandal.\n\nWe have examples of a somewhat different kind of enthusiasm in John Ruskin and Dr. Zamenhof. In Ruskin&apos;s case, as is well known, there was actual physical disability. Science furnishes us with the names of Pasteur, Davy and Alfred Wallace, while an example of pure coldness of nature, with no enthusiasm to replace it, is given by William III.\n\nIt may be a little surprising at first sight to find that poet and dramatist Alfred de Musset had this position of Venus. But the explanation is simple, for in his nativity Venus is on the cusp of the twelfth house, squared by Mars, and she is just turning retrograde. The mental attitude displayed in &lsquo;Gamiani&rsquo;, in which he was at least an accomplice, and many other of his writings, and the extraordinary developments of his personal character are fully explained by these facts.\n\nVenus in Capricorn is a little inclined to be suspicious. The native demands that advances shall be made to him unmistakably, before he commits himself. He dreads rebuff. It is, therefore, necessary in dealing with such a person to give encouragement if it is really desired to accept him.\n\nThere is no danger of perversion in the sign in the ordinary sense of the word, but the native is very likely omnivorous. This applies to all the appetites equally. The native cannot bear to be bothered with refinement of any of the appetites. He wishes possession and demands the response, even more emphasized than his demand. He desires open demonstration of affection and if he imagines that he is being neglected, or if his pride be hurt, he is likely to change from great warmth of affection to the most icy indifference, but once being on intimate terms with a native of this sign, he may be trusted to behave admirably, so long as those conditions persist. He is constant, and a lover of home, preferring the fireside and domestic joys to social functions and the like.\n\nThere is no great aptitude for art connected with this sign and no great feeling for beauty in itself. The native is attracted by strength of character and other peculiarities which do not appeal to the ordinary man. Sometimes the character of the native is undeveloped on ordinary Venusian lines. Moral beauty appeals to him more than any other kind. We may mention in this connection the name of the Preacher Dwight L. Moody and of Arthur Brisbane, but much more characteristic of the usual development of character given by this position is the late Stanford White.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011592,2,NULL,11801,'Venus in Aquarius',NULL,'# Venus in Aquarius\n\nThe general characteristic which we have noticed with the other two airy signs still applies to Aquarius. There is, however, a very strong tendency to a development of the affections on humanitarian lines. It is rare to find domesticity; nor is there any great tendency to intensity of passion. The plane of the affections is mostly spiritual and mental. Such love as exists has always the wings of the eagle and the head of the man. With this position of Venus, the religious and humanitarian instincts often take the place of those natural to the great mass of humanity, e.g., Brigham Young and Rudolf Steiner. The humanitarian impulse is still visible, though in a perverted form, in the anarchist Vaillant; and the perversity is readily explained, since his Venus is squared by a rising Mars.\n\nIn science we have the great names of Tycho Brahe, Newton, and Nostradamus. It is very clear in these cases that the interest of the heart was cosmic, and could not be fettered by deep personal attachments.\n\nIn the domain of the arts we find the names of Maurice Ravel, Handel, and Lord Byron. Ravel said, &ldquo;The only love affair I have ever had was with music.&rdquo; The same may be said of Handel, who never married. Byron acquired considerable notoriety in the matter of his love affairs; but this fact must not mislead the reader. The intention was idealistic. And if, in his search for the rarest thing on earth, he fell from time to time into the hands of vampires, it is to be taken as confirming, not as refuting, our judgment of his quality. His misfortune, indeed, is common. Unless Venus is extraordinarily well dignified, so as to remove her operations altogether from the personal plane, the native is likely to be called unmoral. He or she may try innumerable experiments, all equally disastrous; but no blame should be attached to such good people. The intention is invariably ideal.\n\nThe poet Robert Burns had many friendships with both men and women&mdash;in his chart Mars conjoins Venus in Aquarius.\n\nPeople with Venus in this sign often arouse quite unreasonable jealousy in the marriage partner. Attracted intellectually to a stranger on a first meeting, a person under this influence may treat him or her as an intimate friend. The husband or wife frequently fails to realize that this means nothing. It is because love with such people is so entirely divorced from physical considerations that this occurs. They are extraordinarily constant, unselfish and sincere in love; their motto is to render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar&apos;s and to God the things which are God&apos;s. Having given themselves unreservedly on the physical plane to one person, they regard the matter as closed, but naturally see no reason why that should interfere with a warm intellectual friendship. It is just because they know there is no danger that they act in such a way as to make people think that there is.\n\nVenus in Aquarius gives extraordinary power to divine character. In the case of a portrait artist, for example, he may be able to paint the spiritual rather than the physical image of the sitter, showing in the portrait qualities which perhaps are yet undeveloped. Similarly, especially when Mercury is in the same sign, one finds an excellent diagnostician who, with practically no symptoms to guide him, can yet discover in his patients the root of some deep-seated malady. Aquarius is so very spiritual a sign that its action is almost always likely to cause the native to perceive the transcendental reality beneath the mask of form. We have already insisted that the position of Venus exhibits the primary shape in which the non-ego presents itself to the ego, and, when Venus is in Aquarius, one may say that the native sees things, not so much as they are but as they will be.\n\nWhile the native is not domestic, in the same way as when Venus is in Taurus, the same qualities are manifest, but in a much more intelligent form. A mother with Venus in Taurus is likely to spoil her children; if Venus is in Aquarius she is equally devoted but never foolish. She will pick out the best nurse, not merely the nicest one. She will criticize the child in a most impersonal way and thus develop its real talents, instead of being deluded by imaginary or desired talents into encouraging the wrong one. One may say that the ties of blood are not very important to people with this position of Venus; yet they act as admirably as if they were important, for they base their actions upon the real necessity of the situation, instead of upon mere traditional sentimentality.\n\nThe same characteristics apply in such matters as patriotism. President Wilson is a first-grade example of the action of this position. He did not allow himself to be swayed by the cries of the mob. He considered everything with what many people regard as undue deliberation,, and took no action until he was absolutely satisfied as to the wisdom of the course proposed. He never allowed prejudice or passion to sway him. This is remarkably indicative of the power exercised by this sign, since Mars is in conjunction with Venus&mdash;but they are both trine to his Libra air-sign ascendant and the Moon is also in Aquarius. His personal prejudices were extraordinarily strong, and his character dictatorial and overbearing, yet he did not allow this, as a rule, to hurry him into inconsiderate actions. As an example of the seriousness and general excellence of this position, we have such people as the sculptor Gutzon Borglum, the astrologer Ebenezer Sibley, Dr. Weir Mitchell, and George Ade. We have also Admiral Dewey, Bramwell Booth and Elihu A. Root, in whom these qualities may be studied to advantage.\n\nWe may pay a little more detailed attention to the case of Robert Burns. Here again, Mars is in conjunction with Venus in Aquarius; but in this case expansive Jupiter has just risen in earthy Capricorn, the Moon is in Sagittarius, and the Sun is also part of the Mars-Venus conjunction, lending additional violence to the combination. Hence we find the Scottish poet really very passionate and very fickle, and the influence of the sign is shown mostly by the idealism which gave birth to that fickleness. We also find the humanitarian impulse extremely strong, expressing itself in the broadmindedness and tolerance which was rather rare for his generation.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011593,2,NULL,12057,'Venus in Pisces',NULL,'# Venus in Pisces\n\nIn this sign Venus is in her exaltation. The watery nature of the sign does not make her so voluptuous as we saw to be the case with Cancer and Scorpio. Pisces is too psychic for that to happen. Softness and tenderness are brought out strongly, but are expressed as an unequalled capacity for devotion and self-sacrifice. A very striking example of this is given in the relations of Sir Richard Burton with his wife. In all other respects his nature was fiery, arrogant and domineering; but he treated her with a chivalry which did not even succeed in getting itself understood or appreciated. The same spirit, with a slightly wider field of expression, is found in &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; Gordon.\n\nAs a general rule, indeed, the affections are likely to be widely distributed. When art is concerned, this position seems to give the faculty of handling large groups of people with ease. This is evident in the cases of Zola, Dickens, Victor Hugo and, with slightly less luster, Rosa Bonheur. The affections, generally speaking, are simple and natural. There is a calm kindliness of feeling towards humanity in general, and there is very little tendency to snobbery, none at all to arrogance.\n\nPossibly as a consequence of this, the native does not easily make enemies. On the other hand, he is likely in some measure to spoil his friends. This position does not excite in others that depth of emotion which leads to grand passions and great sacrifices. Relations with others seem to be taken too easily, and their devotion is not likely to develop, as it does often enough in the case of people far less calculated at the first sight to inspire the noblest sentiments. People with this position are usually devoted to their families. They not only love others, but care for and cherish them. Self-sacrifice is natural to the native, whenever his tender feelings are in question.\n\nThere is a great deal of romance mingled with these feelings. The native dissolves himself into the beloved, making a true union, and the greatest sorrow that can be experienced by a person with this position is when the beloved fails to appreciate his devotion to the full. Venus in this sign is not particularly fastidious; she is too ready for the pleasure the yielding gives to others. In some respects this is the highest possible development of Venus. The reader will remember Browning&apos;s poem in which one of the competing lovers says that she does not care what may be the qualities of the beloved, let him be an absolute scoundrel, with no good qualities at all; such a man gives the greatest opportunity for the exhibition of the noblest qualities of love, and the abbé called in to decide the case ends his judgment:\n\n&ldquo;The love which to one, and one only has reference, seems terribly like what perhaps gains God&apos;s preference.&rdquo;\n\nVenus in Pisces is not in the least intellectual; she is intuitive, and this intuition is the outcome of her extraordinary nobility. Her willingness to pay the price, however great, gives her the privilege of a knowledge almost divine in its immediateness.\n\nOne of the most beautiful examples of this position is Edgar Allan Poe. In him, as critics have often pointed out, the instinct of love is almost abnormally pure. There is not a word in his writings which can be called coarse, gross or even free, yet his conception of passion is more romantic, more poetic than that of almost any other writer. In his very rhythm one feels the nature of his love. &ldquo;Annabel Lee&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lenore&rdquo; illustrate magnificently the vision which the poet has of women.\n\nOf course, it is not always to be expected that we shall find this influence in such purity. George Washington took a much more practical view of sex.\n\nSometimes, we discover a romanticism and idealism not necessarily connected with sex. We may put down the passion for exploration which characterized H. M. Stanley and the Duke of the Abruzzi to this position, at least in part. It is the romantic view of things which is indicated. As we have seen in other signs, Venus represents the exterior of things. These explorers translated into the actions of manhood, boyhood&apos;s dream of the romance of geography. Flammarion is in very much the same position with regard to astrology, and the attitude of C. W. Leadbetter towards the astral plane may also be ascribed to this position.\n\nIt is a very good position for actors, who, when they possess it, incline to prefer to undertake the representation of romantic and heroic parts. Henry Irving and William Terris illustrate this point.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

The fiery and precipitate nature of Aries blends admirably with his, and the essential passion of the character, as indicated by Uranus, leaps forward unchecked, to its fullest development. We have, therefore, a long list of famous persons with this position; it will be apparent that even those with inherent weakness of disposition accomplish their ends; the petty, crazy, or ignoble purpose is executed as surely as the lofty configuration and the wise desire.\n\nWe find the Mars of Emmanuel Swedenborg in the Alcabitius system third house, giving great excitability to the mind, but the opposition of Saturn is not very favorable, as this should tend to deny the higher wisdom to that mind. It is interesting to observe Mars thus usurping the position of the mental ruler, Mercury, who will soon be rising. The Moon has great strength from a conjunction to Uranus and a trine from Jupiter. The subjective mind is, therefore, much stronger than the objective or rational mind; so that the intuitions of the native were more nearly correct than his arguments.\n\nSwami Vivekananda, with Mars in opposition to Jupiter, exactly in square to peaceful Venus, and Jupiter in square to the Sun, was hindered as a practical propagandist. The gentleness of his nature was too great to enable him to use a battering-ram against the inertia of other minds. Mars, however, is again in the third house, and we see in him the same forceful intellect, the same iron will to solve the problems of existence. Per se, Mars was adequate; it was only in connection with the non-ego that the weakness appeared.\n\nTo turn to political types, one of the most successful in the world&apos;s history was Queen Victoria. Astute to the point of hiding her political aims from even many of the wise, she aggrandized her throne and held back the republican movement in England with matchless skill. The sextile of Jupiter to her Mars must have been of unqualified assistance in this matter, and accounts for the good fortune which attended her indomitable purpose.\n\nConsider the fiery Cromwell. Here Mars, Lord of the Ascendant, is just above the eastern horizon, with the Sun, Venus, and Mercury rising just below him. Saturn opposed, denies far-sighted political wisdom; perhaps this made it impossible for him to found the dynasty he so dearly hoped for; but the primary position of the planet of battles rendered it impossible for him to fail in courage or energy, as soldier or as ruler.\n\nIn George III Mars appears as obstinacy. The Moon and Uranus square him, making the king deluded and stupid; hence his loss of the American colonies through sheer mismanagement. But Mars is on the cusp of the tenth house, very powerful; so that the ultimate issue of England&apos;s war with Napoleon, who had Saturn in the Midheaven, could never have been in doubt to any enlightened astrologer.\n\nIn literary men, artists, and musicians, this position of Mars seems to imply great mastery of technique, great power of execution. It further seems to mean much brilliancy and energy; even originality is enhanced where Uranus is well placed and favorably aspected.\n\nAmong novelists, for example, Zola and Dickens may be fairly classed together. Their pugnacity and propaganda is all decidedly characteristic of Mars in Aries. Zola&apos;s Mars is exceedingly strong, with Mercury conjoined, the Sun and Moon not far off, Uranus semi-sextile, Neptune sextile, and Saturn trine. Dickens had not nearly so powerful a Mars as this, and it is in the fifth house, confining his pugnacity to his art. It would never have occurred to Dickens to placard London with a violent political squib, as Zola did in Paris. He had to work indirectly through his novels.\n\nCompare now the virile, forceful Baudelaire with the dreamy and gentle Maeterlinck. The latter only has Uranus sextile to Mars which is in the seventh house; it is good enough to win out, but the force is hardly strong enough to be called revolutionary. Baudelaire has Mars in a tremendous complex. Neptune and Uranus conjoined, are square to him&mdash;hence, his eventual paralytic insanity; the Moon stands apart; but Mercury and Pluto in late Pisces and the remaining planets in Aries are in conjunction with him. Here is overwhelming force indeed; and we understand how his passion for the Infinite yet burns in those words of his that seem to corrode the soul like acid!\n\nAlbrecht Dürer has Mars culminating in the ninth house. There is no particular support, so the effect is limited to craftsmanship, especially in working upon metals or with them. Mars, incidentally, is a very angry, passionate, impatient planet when excited to the full; the student will do well to contrast carefully the extremes as presented by Dürer and Baudelaire.\n\nIn music we have two more great originators of superb technique; Chopin and Richard Strauss. The former has Neptune trine and the Sun semi-sextile; Saturn, too, is close to Neptune; and all this tends in a way to modify the fire of Mars, and lead him into subtle channels. Yet in his &ldquo;Polonaises&rdquo; the essential force of the spirit is well represented, as well as the general firmness and conciseness of his technique. Strauss has Venus sextile, Saturn in opposition, Neptune in conjunction; this is a somewhat great excitation of Mars, who, moreover, is in the tenth house, dominating the horoscope. From hence, we may judge, come the wrath and fury of his &ldquo;Electra&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Salome,&rdquo; and the violent perfections of his technique; the conjunction of Neptune obviously accounts for their eccentricity.\n\nHavelock Ellis, to conclude, another militant person, has this same position of Mars. Venus is square, Saturn widely trine, Uranus sextile on one side and the Moon on the other. It is a strong but not a violent complex, and fairly descriptive of his method.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

The heaviness of Taurus weighs him down, and, though he fights with desperate courage, there is not that elan which we found him to possess in Aries. Nor is the Venusian character of the sign favorable to his full development; since, Taurus being earthy, it sometimes occurs that he is degraded to be cruel and callous. Yet, at his best, he is steady and earnest; not so original, brilliant, nor lucky as when in Aries, nor so confident of the issue; but dogged, and as the saying goes: &ldquo;Dogged does it.&rdquo;\n\nWe have examples of this in two of the most patient and persevering of those noble men who have given their lives to extend the empire of knowledge; Sir Isaac Newton and Huxley. The latter, with the Sun in conjunction and Mercury very close, an exact trine of Uranus and a near one of Neptune, has an almost ideal Mars. He is in the eleventh house, showing the influence of the native working through friends and colleagues. Newton&apos;s Mars has sextiles of Jupiter and the Moon and a trine of the Sun within seven degrees; and Uranus is very near the opposition. He was by no means a great fighter, like Huxley, as Mars is not so important in his nativity. Here we see only the patience and labor involved in his work, and the indomitable courage with which he attacked problems.\n\nThe Mars of Annie Besant is formidable enough, with Jupiter and the Moon sextile and Uranus semi-sextile. Mars is rising just below Uranus, and Aries is on the Ascendant. This makes the whole personality militant and ambitious, but, in the absence of help from the Sun or Saturn or even Venus one cannot but regard the complex as unfortunate. Colonel Olcott, on the contrary, has the Sun and Venus square on one side, Uranus square on the other, and Saturn trine. Mars is not the center of activity, but Venus, as Lady of the Ascendant; it is excellent, on the whole, making him an admirable and trustworthy subordinate.\n\nThe horoscope of Houdini gives an excellent example of the extreme power of Mars on the material plane, even enabling him to overcome the strongest oppositions of such material objects as fetters, etc. Saturn and Uranus in opposition to each other are both squaring Mars, a most unusual development of occult powers.\n\nIn the world of literature and art, we find a group deserving careful contrast with those who have Mars in Aries. Compare Reynolds with Dürer, the easy voluptuous style of the one with the austere sincerity of the other. Set Tchaikovsky against Strauss and Chopin; George Sand and Alphonse Daudet against Zola. It at once appears how the brilliancy of the Aries-Mars is weighed down and subdued in Taurus. Against Dickens we may put Dumas, and, though it would be possible to maintain that Dumas is a much more brilliant writer than Dickens, this is a matter of the higher planets; the technique of Dickens sparkles and fumes with brilliancies often ill-harmonized; that of Dumas is infinitely smoother and more voluptuous.\n\nAmong soldiers, compare Cromwell with Charles George Gordon. The latter, daring and courageous as he was, was yet &ldquo;a Christian gentleman.&rdquo; His Mars is toned down by Taurus; and, indeed, one may attribute his failure in the Sudan to a lack of grip in dealing with the fierce Mohammedan spirits that surrounded him&mdash;both Saturn and Neptune trine his Taurus Mars.\n\nWorthy of our careful consideration are two strong examples of Mars gone wrong: Jay Gould and Jesse James. The financier has Saturn in direct opposition, Neptune square, and Mercury and Uranus sextile. The former aspect is here abominably bad. Mars is in the house of friends and we can well understand how he sold out his colleagues. He had energy and intelligence without the integrity. Jesse James, the Wild West outlaw, has a curious pattern where Mars is sextile Jupiter and both are sextile and trine the Sun and Saturn, which oppose each other. There are no connections to this pattern from the gentler planets Moon, Mercury, and Venus, nor from the transcendental planets Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. So, with Mars in stubborn Taurus, Jesse James denied that the slaveholders had lost the war and proceeded to rob and kill during a brutal life that lacked introspection or reflection, until Fate in the form of transiting Saturn caught up with his Mars.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Hardy&apos;s technique lacks alike brilliancy and softness; it is not simple or direct, and yet it is far more intellectually developed than in either of the others. Mercury and the Sun in conjunction naturally tend to emphasize this point, and they are certainly of great assistance; without them the style would have been abrupt and obscure.\n\nIn the world of music, Schumann offers us just the illustration we need, of a very refined and intellectual, but rather thin, technique. Here, again, the conjunction of the Sun saves the situation. Mars is, however, not the important factor in this nativity and it must be remembered that, in speaking of style in these sections, we do not mean the matter or even the manner of an artist, but the actual technical method by which he executes his ideas.\n\nSir David Wilkie is another case in point; he may be contrasted with Reynolds. His method may be called almost perky in comparison with the smooth voluptuousness of the other. The sextile of Jupiter prevents this from too great effect; without it, he would perhaps have been as agitated, violent, and distracted as a futurist.\n\nThe trine of the Sun to Mars doubtless helped to make Lord Roberts a successful soldier, but even here the Gemini influence is apparent. His efforts were bound to be intermittent, and his influence on the army, while it uplifted, did not bind. Devoted to him as his soldiers were, he never succeeded in forming a phalanx like Cromwell&apos;s.\n\nThe same failure in method is seen in Joseph Chamberlain and Cecil Rhodes. Mars in Gemini represents a fault which is best expressed in the language of sport, where it is the very commonest of all errors. In golf and billiards it is called &ldquo;failing to follow through,&rdquo; in rowing &ldquo;being short with the finish.&rdquo; You cannot get full results from a stroke unless you give it power enough to carry to the end. So Chamberlain, with Neptune trining his Mars, and Uranus squaring it, giving it idealism, but lack of continuity, seemed unable to persist in any policy.\n\nRhodes had a little more assistance than this from the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Saturn, and Uranus. The conjunction of Saturn in particular gave more power of persistency. It is an exceptionally strong, if not very well-balanced complex; but the influence of Jupiter, lord of the Ascendant, in opposition to Mars, is really the key to the nativity.\n\nQueen Elizabeth I showed extraordinary caprice in method, none at all in main lines of policy; Uranus was very strong; Mars has Jupiter in opposition, and a trine of Mercury lends her cleverness.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

In fact, it makes the martial energy subtle and profound, dissolving it, as it were, and thus making it more active, just as a solution of phenol is more corrosive than the crystals themselves.\n\nSome of the very greatest artists that have ever lived have this position of Mars; it seems as if the specialized energy which he represents were somehow made universal. There is not that same concentration upon a single line that is shown, for example, by Mars in Aries; there have been found very few instances of politicians or conquerors or even great generals with this position&mdash;the military exceptions that prove the rule include Lafayette, the Duke of Wellington, and Sir Francis Younghusband. Every one of our illustrations has worked for the general good, not the particular good of any person or even any country, unless we consider Alexander II as having done so. But even his action with regard to the serfs should be regarded as the limited expression of a wide humanitarian intention. And in this case Mars has the opposition of Jupiter, though it is directed wisely by Saturn&apos;s trine, and made gentle by the sextile of Venus.\n\nThere is, of course, one very unfortunate career to consider; that of Marie Antoinette. Here Mars is very strong, rising trine to Uranus, with no affliction but a square of the Moon. The Moon ruling the female life, and in this case being Lady of the Ascendant, we must regard her rather than Mars as the key to the complex. We must say then that her Moon is afflicted by the presence on the Ascendant of Mars in his fall. All the good she gets from the complex is a towering practical ambition, which was indeed successful, so far as it went, Uranus trined by Mars being in her tenth house. But Saturn, lord of the seventh, being in his own house in the eighth, afflicting and afflicted by the square of the Moon, even the marriage which gratified her ambition resulted in her death.\n\nTo return to artists, we have the most amazing galaxy: Shakespeare, Petrarch, Byron, Balzac, Mozart, and, in their wake, Coleridge. It is to be noted how, in each case, the universality of sympathy is evident. Each has an enormous field of expression. There is not the intensity of Baudelaire or the single-minded passion of Blake; it is, rather, breadth and objectivity of outlook, and completeness of comprehension of humanity that stand revealed. And to this heavenly court of artists we may add a philosopher, one of the greatest, in every way, that ever lived: Immanuel Kant; while, should they need a mystic, they may include in their ranks the seers Nostradamus and Cheiro.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

The Sun is, himself, fire; in fact, Mars is but the fiery part of the Sun, so that Leo is as favorable to the development of Mars as even Aries; indeed, more so. For the solar influence tends towards balance, breadth, and fullest development in the fiery impulses; Aries is, as it were, too martial to be the highest good for Mars.\n\nWe shall find as a rule, therefore, people with less passionate intensity of action, but with wider sympathies, than we found in Aries. Of course, in some cases Saturn&apos;s influence may override this; one cannot expect a person intensely narrow and selfish to act in accordance with sentiments better illustrated by Jupiter. Yet, all things considered, his method will be broader than had Mars been in Aries.\n\nGeorge Eliot has a most noble and beautiful Mars, trine to the Sun and Venus; it lent force and fire to a rather cramped and disappointed ego. (Her Saturn is sextile to the Moon and square to Uranus and Neptune, implying melancholy.) Hence the brilliance and color of her work is objective; the expression is more genial than that which it expresses.\n\nLily Langtry has Mars in the tenth house very powerful, but squared by Uranus. It is not the important complex. A certain amount of scandal is implied; but the dominant position and generous Zodiacal situation of Mars tend to make this innocuous. The scandal is so big that it becomes a negligible factor.\n\nLord Brougham, again, a man of a most acrid and vitriolic spirit, had Mars in Leo to thank for his breadth of action. He could not (luckily for him) express himself in mean ways.\n\nWilliam Blake is an example of the other side of the picture. Here we find the most tremendous development of the higher faculties, but no adequate and equal disposition of Mars, which, besides being in this exuberant and generous sign, is opposed by difficult Saturn and conjoined by nebulous Neptune. Hence his failure to realize practically his immense conceptions.\n\nHerbert Spencer, on the other hand, has a grand Mars with Saturn trine and the Sun square. Here is great wisdom combined with great activity, steadily forcing the idea upon a reluctant world, by open and honest methods, and indomitable courage, pluck, and perseverance. The square of the Sun implies opposition, and gives some threat to the health.\n\nAnother great-hearted and successful man was General Grant, whose generous action at Appomattox is altogether characteristic of this Mars in Leo position. Lord Bulwer-Lytton is a similar case of great success won by geniality of action.\n\nCaesar Borgia, by contrast, has Mars in conjunction with Saturn, in opposition to Jupiter, and square to Uranus, with no help but the sextile of the Sun and the semi-sextile of Venus. This tends to mask the Leo influence; however, we still see it to some extent in the range of his action; in the pride and splendor with which he worked.\n\nEdward VI of England, on the other hand, has Mars square to Mercury, and in conjunction with Uranus, with only the trine of Neptune to counter balance these misfortunes; and yet we see the Leo influence on Mars still peeping through in the shape of those qualities which make kings lovable. And as he was the best-loved king, save Coeur-de-Lion and Henry the Fifth, that ever ruled England, so was James II the most hated. Here Mars was rising, with the only aspect a close square to Pluto in Taurus. Leo combined with adverse Pluto brought obstinacy and haughtiness into the method. The Sun, lord of Leo, is in Scorpio, badly aspected by a conjunction of Neptune and a square to the Moon, which symbolizes the Public; and, as Leo is rising, the influence is all the more evil.\n\nThe vivid warmth and generosity of Turner&apos;s method of painting is very characteristic, though, happily, of this position. Here Mars is square to the conjunction of Jupiter and Venus, and this appears to have given the force and directness which is the wonder of his technique.\n\nBenjamin Disraeli is a great example of this Leo effect on Mars. His eccentricities were all of a gorgeous order; and he made them part of his career, of his method of influencing his contemporaries. Mars being also lord of the Ascendant, of course made this tendency inevitable.\n\nLord Wolseley is a case of the exuberance of this position of Mars. He was too good-natured and too popular to become a Napoleon. Neptune, too, is in opposition, which would tend to thwart the material benefits of Mars.\n\nThe strength of the Mars of Madame Steinheil is enormous. It is not only angular on the Descendant and sextile to the Moon and square to Pluto, but also trine to the Sun, Jupiter, Neptune, Mercury and Venus in Aries, and to Saturn in Sagittarius. Here is a tremendous complex of eight planets, which stamps her with the very hallmark of success. But the Leo influence still shines in her method; whatever she might do, she would give a sunny smile, and &ldquo;get away with it.&rdquo;\n\nOne is at first heartily surprised to find Robespierre in this long list. But a little investigation soon clears away the difficulty. Mars is in the sixth house, conjoined with Neptune, and square to the Sun. The trine of Jupiter seems here merely to make him effective. Now, Saturn rising and lord of the Ascendant is, with his aspects, the key to the horoscope, and there is no relation between him and Mars. So we see that, after all, the method of the man was totally distinct from his purpose. And what was that method? Leo all over! Big, frank, open talk, generous sentiments, noble aspirations, the phraseology of a Mazzini or a Lincoln! It is an admirable illustration of the &ldquo;mask&rdquo; in astrology. Had Saturn and Uranus aspected Mars, all these sentiments would have been genuine.\n\nMuch geniality is evident in the method of the late J. Pierpont Morgan. He was indeed the Napoleon of finance; there was nothing underhanded, sly or treacherous about his ways; and he was interested in many things beyond his business. The conjunction of Jupiter accentuates this tendency.\n\nSimilarly genial, but not so effective, is the Mars of W. B. Yeats. Here Neptune is trine, and a conjunction of Venus with Pluto is square, neither aspect of great help to the practical side of Mars. It is an admirable picture of the easy openness of his method, both in art and in life. With Saturn trine, instead of Neptune, he might have been as austere as Blake, and as successful as Maeterlinck.\n\nThe glow and riot of Swinburne&apos;s early verse is also to be attributed to this position of Mars. Once again we must insist that we refer to the actual technique, not to the matter or the manner. With Jupiter conjoined, Mercury and Venus trine, and Neptune in opposition, we can well explain the rhythms with which he enriched the English language.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

There is a certain passionate chastity about it; real warmth of heart in the conventional sense appears to be denied. It will be seen that, of all upon our list, though many are great men and women, not one can be called a great lover. This remark applies as much to method as in the preceding sections; it refers to a certain coldness and detachment of action, as if the enthusiasms were not awakened. Yet the will may be extremely strong. The women on our list are almost ostentatiously passionless, and the men hardly less so. In the devotion to a cause, we find two of the greatest women who ever lived, Clara Barton, organizer of the American Red Cross, and Madame Blavatsky, co-founder of the Theosophical Society.\n\nBefore adding the name of Anna Kingsford to these, we must anticipate the objection that she boasted of an intensely sensual disposition, but here Mars is exaggerated by a square from Jupiter and Virgo is warmed by the Sun, Venus, and Mercury, the first of these being in very close conjunction with Mars. However, there is no trace of eroticism in her work, and it is the actual method of expressing the personality which is denoted by Mars, not the nature of that personality itself.\n\nAmong men we have Balfour, with Mars on the Leo/Virgo cusp, whose cold intellectualism is at once his charm and his weakness; Kruger, notably the most dexterous and cool politician of his period; Dreyfus, whose detachment made him so unpopular with his men, and thus led to his being accused by his brother officers; Archbishop Laud, whose lack of warmth lost him his friends; William III, most unpopular as a king, owing to his &ldquo;Dutch coldness&rdquo;; and Louis XVI, whose lack of sympathy with the needs of his people caused his downfall.\n\nFinally, we have two of the greatest generals that the world has known: Napoleon Bonaparte and General George S. Patton. Napoleon had Mars trine to both Pluto and Uranus. Patton had Mars square to both Pluto and Mercury. Both of these owed their greatness very largely to this power of detachment in their method; both, however keenly interested in a matter, were able to view it and treat it as if it hardly concerned them; and this is the chief virtue of Mars in Virgo.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Libra rather tempers his activity with judgment; and, if he be well dignified, he may be as strong here as anywhere. He becomes more effective through being more controlled. But, in every case we examine, we shall find an excellent quality of direction given to him; just as the explosive force of gunpowder gains in effectiveness by virtue of the very limitation of the barrel of the rifle.\n\nSadi Carnot of France, for instance, was by no means so ambitious as Cromwell, who had Mars in Aries; but he did not need to use the same violence. His method was admirably adjusted to circumstances, and he attained his ends without recourse to undue force. He measured his actions carefully, and there was no lack of power, but at the same time no excess. Felix Faure, with the same position of Mars, gives exactly similar evidence of its action.\n\nShelley had the same quality; it appears in his work continually. It is indeed admirable, this harmony of motion which one perceives in his rhythm. If it be contrasted with that of Swinburne, the difference between Leo and Libra will appear quite obvious.\n\nAnother admirable illustration of the judicial temperament is the method of the brilliant scientist Sir William Hamilton, dignified, well-considered, convincing; Mars in Libra forms a sextile to the Moon, paralleled by Saturn in Libra sextile the Sun, with the Sun and Saturn forming a close Yod to the deep outer planet Pluto. In the case of natural scientist Charles Darwin, who took decades to research and publish his work, both the Sun and Moon closely aspect deliberate Mars in Libra.\n\nThere are two well-known British statesmen with this position for Mars, Mr. Asquith and Winston Churchill. The same tempered and adroit energy is characteristic of both.\n\nScientist and inventor Sir Humphrey Davy, too, has this admirably moderated fire. Without violence or controversy, he managed to have his way, owing to the proper control of his energy by his judgment. In the case of romantic poet and dramatist Alfred de Musset, one may say, this is not so obvious. There was a good deal of overproduction of energy in his machine, which made for vehemence of expression. But his Mars is powerfully excited by the square of Venus, the semi-sextile of Uranus; and the sextiles of a conjunction of Sol, Mercury and Saturn make up a formidable complex, to which, however, Mars is not the key, but Saturn. It is a very powerful combination, and the calming influence of Libra is to be thanked for the restraint of his method. This should be contrasted with that of Baudelaire, whose complex key is equally powerful, but who has Mars in Aries.\n\nOccasionally it may occur that Libra is too powerful. Much of Bernard Shaw&apos;s apparent inconsistency is due to the fact that he has unrivaled capacity for seeing both sides of every argument with equal clarity, and often sets both together on the same page, or even in the same sentence.

Almost any influence but his own touches his fire to rationality, generosity, or grace. But Scorpio, while in some ways the most powerful of the signs, may be described as snake-tempered; and in it he easily becomes bloodthirsty. It is even amusing to note how one of the gentlest spirits that ever dwelt within the human form, Robert Louis Stevenson, is often in method outrageous almost beyond the &ldquo;penny dreadful.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Treasure Island,&rdquo; cold-blooded murderers tumble over each other&apos;s heels, in circumstances of unparalleled atrocity. Who, without the help of Mars in Scorpio, could have invented Long John Silver, hopping after his comrade and braining him with his crutch, or the attempt, in &ldquo;The Ebb-Tide,&rdquo; of Hurst to throw vitriol over Atwater, and the breaking of the bottle in his hand by the ready rifle of the pearler?\n\nThere can be a complete lack of adaptability in this position of Mars; it is sometimes replaced by treacherous cunning; but, as a general rule, the method of the native tends to be brute force. The anarchist Vaillant may be cited as an illustration. Such extreme cases are fortunately rare and imply bad aspects. In this particular instance, Mars has the sextiles of Jupiter and Saturn, which make him effective, but his quality is deteriorated by the square of Venus. Stalin has Pluto opposing his Mars; made effective by a trine from Saturn. The violence of Mrs. Pankhurst, again, is undoubtedly due to this position, for Mars is not otherwise afflicted. On the contrary, he is helped by a sextile of the Moon and trines of Neptune and the Sun. Her undoubted nobility of character and the altruism of her violent action indicate the vision conferred by the trines of Neptune and the Sun which the sextile of the Moon directs toward the masses of women. Miss Frances E. Willard may be advantageously compared with Mrs. Pankhurst. Mercury is sextile to Mars, Jupiter semi-sextile; and the complex is important, Sagittarius being the rising sign and Mars only six degrees above the Eastern Horizon. Hers is a far more rational and effective method than that of the later suffragist. Mme. Patti has Mars trined by Uranus, and squared by the Sun and Neptune in conjunction, which appears an extremely advantageous disposition. Medical lexicographer Sir Richard Quain has both Mercury and the Sun, Lord of the Ascendant, in conjunction with Mars, and Venus is semi-sextile. These aspects go far to minimize the effect of Scorpio.\n\nPsychologist Roberto Assagioli has his Scorpio Mars square to both Venus and Saturn, plus a wide sextile to the Moon; Mars aspecting these planets added energy to his knowledge of relationships and the feeling self. The Mars of singing tenor Enrico Caruso is trine to a conjunction of Mercury with the Sun. The Mars of Gandhi is part of a powerful complex&mdash;conjunct peaceful Venus, but opposing Jupiter and Pluto and square to the Moon; his Mars also contacts a close square between outer planets Uranus and Neptune; Scorpio can give the strength to master these transcendent energies. Joseph P. Kennedy was born with Mars conjunct Jupiter and sextile to Mercury and Venus&mdash;all fortunate aspects. Lawrence of Arabia had his Mars square a conjunction of Mercury-Saturn in Leo, adding energy to the mental and linguistic faculty plus rugged endurance, but not promising happiness. Albert Schweitzer was born with Scorpio Mars exactly squaring an exact opposition of Saturn in Aquarius to Uranus in Leo, where Uranus is high in the tenth house; Schweitzer devoted his life to humanitarian service. The Scorpio Mars of George Washington is strong by position, angular on the Descendant, but the only aspects to be found are to its higher octave, Pluto.

The symbol of the arrow was chosen to express that curious quality. In the case of a heavy and slow-moving planet, the action will be, perhaps, to quicken it to some extent; but with Mars, which is already fast and fiery, there is no such compensating influence. Mars tends to become meteoric when in this sign. Unless the energy be carried on for a reasonably long period, it does not begin to have a fair chance to work. What can be done in a moment may be done exceedingly well; but works involving the element of time are likely to be failures. Our examples, therefore, will give us people scintillating rather than solid, dashing rather than enduring.\n\nThe swift brilliance of Oscar Wilde is to the point. He was incapable of large construction; his ideas were like shooting stars. Lewis Carroll has an identical limitation, and so had Rudyard Kipling, whose forte is short stories of extreme brilliance and who has written but two novels of any length, both of which are little more than a series of brilliant episodes.\n\nExceedingly curious and highly illustrative is the case of &ldquo;Datas, The Memory Man&rdquo; (W.J.M. Bottle). His marvelous memory never forgets a date, but he remembers only disconnected items. It is not at all the same memory as that of Gladstone, who knew Homer by heart. Extremely typical is this of the syncopating action of Sagittarius.\n\nCharles I showed the same in his kingship. He would start a strong man&apos;s policy one evening, and weaken on it before lunch next day, only to conceive something else equally violent at supper time. This was an effect in method of action, not at all in the will to govern, which was perfectly consistent.\n\nLouis XIV is a surprising conclusion to the list, especially as Mars is squared by Mercury, and has nothing better than a sextile of Uranus to offset this affliction. Mars, however, is very strong by position, rising; and he is the lord of the Ascendant.\n\nIt is not wonderful that so few persons of note are born with this position of Mars; for, however great they may be within themselves, this fatal defect of discontinuity usually prevents them from translating themselves to the external and objective world.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

His fierce energy is tempered to obstinacy by the earthy and Saturnian nature of the sign, but, on the other hand, the leaping Goat lends additional power and elan to his activity. He becomes tremendously magnetic and commanding, but also dour and tenacious. A striking instance of his quality expressed in the world of action is Theodore Roosevelt. One has only to contemplate his method to understand the full effect of Mars in Capricorn.\n\nIn the world of science, we have two men of incomparable vigor and persistence, Pasteur and Edison; while, to return once again to political life, we find Edward VII with this position of Mars. This is a very astonishing case; there is little of high ability to be found in this monarch, but Mars, rising in this sign, gave him the executive force to carry through the Triple Entente, one of the greatest diplomatic achievements in the world&apos;s history.\n\nThe persuasiveness and eloquence of Cicero may be put down to his Mars, which conjoins both Uranus and Mercury and sextiles Jupiter. The activation of Mars in Saturn&apos;s sign accounts for the polemical character of much of his writings and speeches; but the method remains as a model of grace and vigor.\n\nGoethe also has this position; in this connection we notice the brusquerie of much of his verse, its leaping, forceful, direct quality. That any man could win such signal triumph is amazing; the art of poetry seems to demand smoothness rather than this abrupt sledge-hammer method. Rossetti, for example, with the same position, scores only partial success. The rough scansion of much of his verse must be called a flaw, whereas with Goethe it was a virtue. But Rossetti&apos;s Mars is in conjunction with Neptune and in opposition to Saturn, with an abundance of fixed Taurus and Scorpio, while Goethe&apos;s Mars is trine to Mercury and the Sun, with the emphasis upon mutable Virgo and Pisces.\n\nRuskin and Tolstoi have also this position, but Ruskin&apos;s Mars is the storm-center of a great complex, which considerably modifies the effect, while Tolstoi&apos;s is in conjunction with Neptune, increasing its eccentricity and violence by harnessing materialism with mysticism.\n\nAmong women we have Cleo de Merode with the Moon closely trine and the Sun and Venus in wide square to Mars. From this comes her incomparable power to have her own way in everything. Incidentally, the planet is on the cusp of her eleventh house, and its main effect is therefore to enable her to influence friends. The trine of the Moon includes the public among such friends, and modifies the fierceness of her method by masking it with a show of yielding grace. In reality, she was just as full of will and determination as Cromwell.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

The method will be expansive, free, open, and yet full of wisdom. There are, of course, unfortunate exceptions. If over-excited by some dangerous aspect, the airy formula may be as distracting as that given by Gemini.\n\nMary, Queen of Scots, suffered from this airy temperament in her mode of action, for, though the Sun was sextile, Saturn was square, and Uranus in opposition.\n\nAnother instance is Marie Bashkirtseff. No doubt, as in the previous case, Mars is active enough. That is not the point; the point is that Mars is too active. Her great ambition is due to a close square by Pluto, which led to her peculiar temper and her method of attempting to achieve her ends, as described in her diary.\n\nAquarius, on the whole, gives far more freedom of action to Mars than does Capricorn; hence occasionally we find looseness in its method, and, in all cases, the native is more a man of thought than of action. Even such tremendous driving forces, practical as ever lived, as Gladstone, Bismarck, and John Bright, all shared in this expansive&mdash;one may almost dare to say imaginative&mdash;type of action. With all but the very greatest, there is likely to be some hindrance implied. Alfred Russell Wallace was not the fighting force that his intellectual capacity would have stood for. The Earl of Strafford, Thomas Wentworth, in particular, was afflicted sorely in this matter. In his situation he needed an extraordinarily close-knit, terrible Mars. The opposition of Neptune on one side and the squares of the Sun and Mercury on the other were certainly detrimental, and the Aquarius tendency asserted itself unchecked.\n\nA last example of weakness is Ludwig II of Bavaria, whose Mars is made fatally eccentric in its action by the conjunction of Neptune with no counter-balance. Here the royal power itself was actually frittered away in whimsical intellectualities.\n\nRichard Wagner has the same position of Mars, but the aspects are so different that Aquarius brings out the best instead of the worst. Jupiter in Leo opposes his Mars; Mercury in Taurus receives the powerful square energy of both Mars and Jupiter, while Venus and the Sun in conjunction are trine, and Mars is culminating in the tenth house. It is, therefore, a great and important complex, and it is never to be forgotten that, in such circumstances, it is less important whether planets have &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; aspects; the fact of their existence in the complex is itself an element of strength; half a loaf is better than no bread!\n\nAnother figure of amazing stature with this position is Victor Hugo. Mars has only a trine of Uranus and approaching a sextile of Mercury; there is therefore something lacking in his method.

The sign is watery, receptive, sensitive, and psychic&mdash;the very antithesis of the fiery, dominant, brutal, and material planet. Very few people with this detrimental position, unless strongly aspected, reach any remarkable goal; even the greatest men are so hampered in their external expression that their greatness passes unremarked in a world that can only be conquered by battle-axes and sledge-hammers. A great tragedy of the Victorian period stands witness to this fact.\n\nWe have already called attention to the horoscope of Sir Richard Burton. Uranus is conjoined with Neptune, and four other planets fortify the complex. Mars himself in conjunction with Venus and semi-sextile to Saturn, is lord of the Ascendant, while, without much straining, these two complexes may be unified through the Moon and Mercury. Here, then, are the nine planets all more or less related, as in the case of Shakespeare; and truly the mind of Burton was no less than his. Yet the effect of Pisces on Mars is so deadly that the whole of his externalization was nullified. He should have been Viceroy of India and Governor-General of Egypt; but, as he himself said, he &ldquo;possessed every talent but that of making use of the others!&rdquo;\n\nErasmus was another individual of rare distinction&mdash;the greatest scholar of the Middle Ages. But here again there was no capacity for externalizing his powers; even poor old Cornelius Agrippa had a far greater influence in Europe; while Paracelsus outshone both.\n\nLord Curzon would have enjoyed his sumptuous life as Viceroy of India more if the Venus-Jupiter opposition that forms the focus of a Grand Fire Trine Kite pattern did not also square Mars in Pisces in the ninth house, which became the focus of a Mutable T-Square. He was a bold world traveler and a social reformer, but he suffered from constant back pain and, after he sent Francis Younghusband on an expensive expedition to mysterious Lhasa, his career became erratic, never achieving the Prime Ministership to which he aspired.\n\nVincent Van Gogh&apos;s Mars in Pisces conjoins and squares emotional Venus and the Moon. In Michelangelo&apos;s more fortunate chart, Mars trines both Saturn and Uranus&mdash;a Grand Water Trine. These deep geniuses left the world richer, but were as unworldly as Neptune, the ruler of Pisces. The world may have trouble seeing or appreciating the higher planes where Mars in Pisces strives.\n\nNell Gwyn has this position, too, but Mars is a very curious planet in the case of women. It is difficult to assert anything positively with so little evidence as is forthcoming, but one may suspect that Mars and Venus are counterchanged for feminine horoscopes rather as are the Sun and the Moon, though not so effectively. In any case, Mars has the trine of Jupiter on one side and that of the Moon on the other, which would amply redeem any radical weakness of the planet, especially as he is rising.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

If Jupiter is not afflicted seriously, the combination promises a generous, ardent, and high-minded disposition, with a strong inclination to the study of science, literature, or religion. The more purely benevolent qualities of Jupiter, however, are somewhat repressed, and, at times this position may even mean the complete transmogrification of the religious instinct into something very like ambition. It will, in any case, make the native, to a considerable extent, a pioneer or an innovator, with a very positive and material outlook on those subjects which are accepted by the majority of men with passive reverence; and, while actual atheism is not necessarily implied, there is very likely to be a tendency to that unspoken skepticism which is characteristic of those who regard religious organizations as a branch of politics.\n\nSir Richard Burton has a very strong Jupiter, both Mercury and Saturn being in conjunction with him. The conjunction of Uranus and Neptune gives deep mysticism, but the Aries position keeps him in the middle path. Hence his strong leaning toward the religion of Mohammed, and the sentiments so splendidly expressed in his &ldquo;Kasidah,&rdquo; one of the greatest religious and philosophical poems ever written. Very different is Alfred Tennyson, whose Jupiter is softened by the sextile of Venus (but what amazing good fortune it brought him!) and is somewhat irritated by the square of Mercury. Both weaken and conventionalize Jupiter; hence we find the religion of Tennyson quite orthodox and ritualistic, picturing rather its sentimental spirit. Contrast this with Baudelaire, where the Sun, Venus, Mars, and Saturn are all in conjunction with Jupiter. The man is all religion, his whole life one strenuous protest against the limitations of earthly life. That he failed to find a solution of his problems is due to the fact that, like Burton, he had Uranus and Neptune square to this immense combination. Bernard Shaw is a good type of the skeptic. Saturn squares Jupiter, as with Alexander VI, but fortunately Venus is trine. Here, then, we get a soft hearted and kindly man, but with his religious instincts quite inhibited from ordinary channels by the fact that the inspired vision is denied to him. Even the trine of the Sun does not make up for this defect; it acts here more on the material plane, and gives him great success, but does not illuminate. Had Jupiter been in a more religious sign, belief would have been easier for Shaw.\n\nConsider, in this connection, Chopin. Here Jupiter is sesquiquadrate to Neptune, which rules the chart from the cusp of the fourth house; the aspect expresses itself in the innovative but bittersweet quality of his compositions; Jupiter also receives a wide square from the Moon in Capricorn, his music had a heartfelt quality and great religious feeling. In the case of Madame Steinheil, we see much greater strength of Jupiter, who is in conjunction with the Sun and Venus and not far from conjunction with Mercury and Neptune. But Jupiter is not by any means the strongest of these planets, and so does not control the complex; Saturn in the tenth house, trining all these planets, dominates the horoscope, so that all these varied impulses of her nature tended to subserve her selfishness. Had Jupiter and Saturn been in each other&apos;s places, we should have had in her horoscope the figure of a great religious leader.\n\nThese cases should be sufficient to indicate not only the nature of the limitations which Aries imposes upon Jupiter but also the favorable indications of natural success and prosperity which the combination furnishes when Jupiter is not badly aspected. It gives ability in managing large enterprises or organizations, self-confidence, and a desire to be at the head of the undertakings.\n\nThose born with Jupiter in Aries are seldom contented and happy unless they can be in a type of work where leadership, personal self-assertiveness, and pioneering are necessary to success. Those with Jupiter in Aries are never contented with a routine job, or one in which their personalities are constantly subjected to others.\n\nThese people have ability in managing large enterprises or organizations, and have a desire to be at the head of any undertaking in which they may be engaged. They find it necessary, however, to guard against giving the impression that they are over-confident and that their ideas are not practical. Men active in politics, club or organization work, and those who meet with success in military life, or in any business connected with fire, railroads, or machinery, are born with Jupiter in Aries. Even if not personally interested in these undertakings, investments in them should yield good returns.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

The native is fixed in his religious beliefs, and in his opinions generally, is of devout and warm-hearted nature and clothed with much pride. But, unless the planet is well posited and dignified, there is danger of crassness and of extravagance. For example, Ludwig II of Bavaria, whose Jupiter is squared by Saturn, lacked wisdom; his extravagant enthusiasms cost him his throne and his life. One sees, too, in his religious ideas, the obstinacy of the earthy Taurus; the decorum of religion was all in all to him. Contrast his nativity with that of the poet Dante Alighieri, the central religious figure of the most religious age of mankind&mdash;we speak here of the outward forms of religion, for ancient Egypt and even pagan Greece were really far more deeply spiritual. In Dante&apos;s horoscope, Jupiter is powerfully placed just above the eastern horizon, with Mercury and Saturn in conjunction from Gemini, to refine any of Jupiter&apos;s excesses; but Mars and Venus in sextile, to enhance the life force, and the Moon in opposition, adding human feeling.\n\nThe literary figure of Alfred de Musset may well be contrasted with that of Baudelaire, whose Jupiter was in Aries. Here Jupiter in Taurus and in the third house has a semi-sextile of the Moon, with no other planet affecting these influences. This indicates a mind incapable of real religious thought, Jupiter here meaning only preoccupation with self-indulgence, a situation leading naturally to boredom and despair. A stronger Jupiter in a more spiritual sign could have saved him from this sad end. The Jupiter of Louis Pasteur is in the eighth house, the natural position of Scorpio, whose influence thus blends with the Taurus qualities to give an instinct for laborious inquiry into scientific matters, and additional energy is given by the trine of Mars and the sextile of Pluto to Jupiter. The religion of such a man must be material and practical; expressed in no emotional or sentimental manner, but none the less deep and sincere. He may also be assured of good fortune with such a disposition of Mars, that fortune depending on his own energy and will.\n\nTurner is another fine example of a good Jupiter in Taurus. Here Neptune is trine, Venus in conjunction, Mars square and Pluto trine. There is a mystical element in his work from the first planet, softness and richness and beauty of form from the second, and intense realistic power from the third and fourth. Jupiter on the cusp of the fourth house, the natural place of Cancer, may explain his great success in painting the sea, and indeed for his choice of canvas as the medium through which to express his religious emotion.\n\nSchumann, for example, has Mars semi-sextile to Jupiter in conjunction with the Sun. A sextile of Pluto helped him compose music that was &ldquo;fantastic and mad.&rdquo; But it is not nearly so strong a combination as Turner&apos;s, though Jupiter is again in the fourth house, indicating the reflective method of expression. The expansive part of his nature is not strong, and the conjunction of Saturn and Neptune in the house of friends turns the strain into a minor key.\n\nRosa Bonheur is a far more jovial figure. A conjunction of the Moon, Uranus, and Neptune is trine to her Jupiter; Mercury and Venus are conjunct in the fifth house; her predilection for painting bulls or stallions is indicated by Taurus. The whole figure is massive, strong, expansive, and genial.\n\nWe might have contrasted with Pasteur another man of science, Alfred Russell Wallace. Here the Sun, Venus, and Mercury are fairly near the trine of Jupiter, though not very close; the religious side of the nature is stimulated thereby, indeed, but the combination is not nearly so strong a motive as is the trine of Saturn to Uranus and Neptune. Hence the intellect ruled for a time, but, when old age came, the religious nature was more prominent, and this proved rather conventional&mdash;a surprise to his friends and colleagues and disciples, for there was little harmony between the former and latter views. General Grant has a robust Jupiter, rising in Taurus, with the Sun and Saturn in conjunction, and with Neptune and Uranus close to the trine. The effect of Saturn in conjunction with the Sun appears to be contrary to any deep spirituality; this seems to bring all forces to work on the plane of normal life; and, though Grant had a hearty sort of faith, one is more impressed by the extreme good fortune which attended him, no doubt largely due to the position of Jupiter. Edward VI of England has a fine Jupiter, trined by Saturn. This may explain why, despite his early death, he remains famous as a monument of early piety, learning, and good disposition.\n\nThe native with Jupiter in Taurus is fond of home and unlikely to travel much unless under the compulsion of business, or because of other planetary combinations. The position, unless Jupiter is badly afflicted, is fortunate for gain through agriculture, building and mining.\n\nThough generous, he may, in some cases, be over-fond of money for its own sake.\n\nThose born with Jupiter in Taurus require a kind of work where constructiveness, systematic building, and a certain amount of routine bring success. Even though the mind may be radical in interest and advanced in thought., the method of procedure will be one of careful and conservative action.\n\nThese people are natural builders; but it largely depends upon circumstances whether they use their constructive force in erecting a skyscraper, in running a ranch, in opening a new mine, in building a factory, or establishing a rundown business on a paying basis. As Taurus rules the throat, Jupiter in this sign often gives one a sympathetic speaking or singing voice. It is interesting to note that Jupiter and Pluto were on the Taurus ascendant of powerful lyric soprano Geraldine Farrar. Women having Jupiter in Taurus make natural home builders, devoted mothers, and are successful as interior decorators or in activities with or for children.\n\nLanded property will prove to be one of their safest forms of investment.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Fiery and watery signs, especially the latter, are far more suitable for the development of these sides of Jupiter&apos;s nature. In Gemini, while Jupiter&apos;s position is favorable for culture and the intellectual side of religion, the native is mentally restless or changeable, and there is often a tendency to mysticism or to the eclectic in religious expression. As, however, there is no antagonism between Jupiter and the Lord of the sign, much, as usual, will depend upon the elevation and aspects.\n\nOne of the greatest religious geniuses of modern times&mdash;very Jupiterian both in devotionalism and humanitarianism&mdash;was medical doctor Anna Kingsford. Here Jupiter, though in Gemini, has the sextile of Uranus, which prevents any conventionality in the religious nature; and the square of Mars and the Sun makes it necessary for her to realize her convictions rather than blindly to believe. Jupiter in the fourth house of the home trine the Ascendant, combined with Pluto in the house of money, gave her an annual inheritance income and wherewithal for her different causes: feminist, anti-vivisectionist, and spiritual.\n\nCompare with this figure Archbishop Laud&apos;s Jupiter, in the ninth house. Here there is a close square of the Moon and another of Mars from the other side. Neptune is close to the cusp of the Midheaven, which may account for the extraordinary fame of Laud; there are not half a dozen archbishops in English history whose names are as well known. He has the lucky trine of Jupiter to the Ascendant, which helped his rise in life from an orphanage, and Jupiter is the focus of a T-Square from the Moon and Mars; Saturn is in wide opposition and this may be the basis for some saying that his religious qualities are shallow, possibly assumed as a cloak for the ambition.\n\nDickens appears to have a strong Jupiter, witness his strong sense of humanitarianism. There are no aspects, however, to influence his quality one way or the other except the wide trine of the Sun, and accordingly there is some diffuseness&mdash;some, perhaps, may say even shallowness&mdash;in the expression of the religious instinct in his art. His is a very good example of a strong Jupiter in Gemini without the admixture of other influences. His compassion for the common man comes from a conjunction of the Moon and Neptune in Sagittarius angular on the fourth house cusp. Two other and greater stars of literature have this position of Jupiter: Balzac and Byron.\n\nWith Balzac, Jupiter is in the tenth house. Mars and Venus are semi-sextile; so, on the other side, is Mercury; and the Sun is only seven degrees from exact conjunction. Pluto is square from Pisces. The humanitarian aspect is stronger than in Dickens, and the whole configuration is more compact and better directed. Mars and Mercury, friendly, add truth; Venus, tenderness and beauty of form; the Sun adds to the fire and art; while Pluto adds depth and intensity. The vast superiority of the close-knit &lsquo;La Comedie Humaine&rsquo; to the more diffuse novels of the English author is in exact accordance with the prediction of their horoscopes.\n\nByron&apos;s Jupiter is part of a Grand Air Trine with Neptune and Pluto, but the Neptunian influence makes the action of Jupiter rather sporadic and intermittent, and he is further constricted by being in the twelfth house. A rising Mars with Uranus just below him seem more important significators in the nativity; and the Moon, as Lady of the Ascendant in close conjunction with Uranus, is easily discernible as the key of the complex. Hence we do not find any great humanitarianism, but that strong love of freedom which is given to the Moon by Uranus.\n\nOf the truly religious type, Cardinal Gibbons furnishes a fine example. Jupiter being in the house of friends, preferment was sure; but a close trine of Saturn makes the religious nature strong and sincere; an equally close square of Venus from Virgo is in this respect favorable, since her affliction makes asceticism the rule of his life.\n\nIn Edison, the square from Venus in Pisces to Jupiter indicates the life of self-denial; Saturn, however, also square, forbids any religious bias; while Uranus being sextile to Jupiter turns the development all to the side of science. Innovative Neptune has many close aspects.\n\nA study of the Jupiter of Wilhelm II is of unusual interest, since its analysis should indicate whether he is the ambitious, self-seeking tyrant and despot his enemies contend, or whether he really did his best to keep the peace in Europe. Jupiter has the sextile of Saturn, and the trine of the Sun and, though Jupiter is near the cusp of the twelfth house, and Saturn is rising in the second, the opposition of the Sun to the latter seems to make it unreasonable to call Saturn stronger than Jupiter. The matter is, however, complicated by the conjunction of Mars and Neptune in the tenth house, which dominates the horoscope. Mars is exactly trine the ruler of the Ascendant, the Moon. Astrologers now know about Pluto, which is the focus planet of a powerful Fixed T-Square pattern from the Sun and Saturn in the Emperor&apos;s chart. His Jupiter in Gemini may have made him a normally congenial ruler, but without any softening aspects his Pluto could see only fear and power. On the whole, it appears that the European catastrophe was a fatality beyond the power of any man to cause or avert, or even to hasten or retard to any great extent. In any case the Kaiser&apos;s Jupiter in Gemini is a very evident cause of the airy way in which he ventilates his religious convictions, and his &ldquo;I and my God&rdquo; goes one better than Cardinal Wolsey&apos;s &ldquo;I and my King.&rdquo;\n\nThe occupations and material affairs, over which Jupiter rules, will develop prominently in the native&apos;s life, with a natural tendency to professional or diplomatic pursuits; but, if Jupiter is afflicted, this position often tends to produce differences with, or separations from, the near relatives. There is much sympathy, benevolence, and charity in the disposition, and the diplomacy of the native usually amounts to a positive gift, enabling him to get his own way without arousing opposition.\n\nThose born with Jupiter in Gemini will have a natural desire to make money through some professional, diplomatic or mental pursuit. Seldom will any form of manual labor be agreeable. Brilliance takes the place of routine, and any routine task will be obnoxious. Patience and persistence are not characteristic virtues of this type.\n\nMany bankers, brokers, promoters, lawyers, diplomats, public speakers, actors, artistic and professional men have been born with Jupiter in Gemini. These people should guard against allowing their interests to be too much divided, although their Jupiter being in Gemini often makes them successful in two different enterprises at the same time. They should guard against going into new ventures before looking into them most carefully, as they naturally attract schemers. These people have an ability to get their own way, without arousing opposition, which amounts almost to a gift. The cut-and-dried business man, unless he is very polished, does not appeal to the average woman having Jupiter in this sign.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

This is undoubtedly the case; the native is good-humored, benevolent, and humane; the emotional nature and the imagination are strong; but the pleasantest qualities are more evident in the nativities of private persons than in those of the great. In those there will nearly always be a counterbalance, or life would be dissipated into mere pleasure.\n\nThe chart of the French novelist Marcel Proust is instructive because Jupiter is angular right on the fourth house cusp, from which it squares Mars and opposes Saturn. The themes of Proust&apos;s life and work were guilt and memory, set into motion by the death of his mother. Cancer has a strong connection to home, mother, tradition, and education. Steel magnate and library philanthropist Andrew Carnegie has Jupiter trine rising Mercury and square to Pluto. Born just five days after Carnegie with the same Scorpio ascendant, Mark Twain (Clemens) has the same Mercury and Pluto aspects plus he has Jupiter square the Moon, ruler of Cancer, which emphasizes the connection to the public and the common man. Oliver Cromwell, the wealthy landowner who became the Lord Protector for England after its civil war and who then voluntarily relinquished his position, had Jupiter in the fourth in aspect to the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Saturn. Another statesman who labored for the public good was Benjamin Franklin, whose Cancer Jupiter opposes his Sun and is in quintile to Saturn; his brilliance and his robust physical health stems from a grand Fire trine between Mars, Neptune, and Pluto. He also had Moon sextile Venus, which made him successful as a diplomat.\n\nLet us look at the Jupiter of two strong, self-centered men, Jay Gould and Joseph Chamberlain, and of one weak, selfish man, James II. Jay Gould has Jupiter in conjunction with Venus, which turns the self-indulgence shown by Cancer into love of money, and of course implies great luck in getting hold of it. There are no good aspects. Chamberlain has Saturn square, which removes the religious and philanthropic impulses. James II has Uranus square to Jupiter, and the Moon semi-sextile. This is weakness. Jupiter is lord of the ninth house; so we find, as we should expect, religious bigotry, the affliction by Uranus denying illumination.\n\nDr. Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, with his benevolent ideas should have a strong Jupiter; and, indeed, the planet has a trine to innovative Neptune and is inconjunct to Sun and Mercury. These aspects are not strong enough to carry the idea to a successful accomplishment; for this, there should have been favorable aspects to Uranus and Mercury; had there been, we might indeed have had a &ldquo;universal language&rdquo; that would have commended itself to the world. John Bright, one of the really fine religious and humanitarian types of the Victorian era, has Jupiter just above the Ascendant; where he is the only planet in the east and is the focus of a Yod pattern from Venus, Neptune, and Mars.\n\nIn everyday life, the native who has Jupiter in Cancer is imaginative and intuitional, sometimes with inclinations for psychism or other mysteries. The position gives excellent aptitude for moneymaking and the ability to hold money after it has been acquired. He is likely to travel much by water, but is fond of home and is apt to find himself very closely bound by affection to his mother.\n\nPeople born with Jupiter in Cancer have a splendid sense of the practical and natural values of life. The disposition allows for a wider range of vocation, but not for any wider attitude toward the work at hand. Some of our most successful politicians, manufacturers, wholesale merchants, chemists or men interested in shipping or other enterprises connected with liquids, have Jupiter placed in Cancer. It often causes them to deal with something that is used in the home or on the persons and gives excellent aptitude for making money, as well as the ability to accumulate it, although they are often too conservative in business, frequently missing opportunities through too great caution. It makes one a gracious host and a liberal provider for the home.\n\nWomen having Jupiter in this sign frequently marry men in public life. They make excellent nurses, meet with success in domestic science or in the care of children and the home, also in work connected with food.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011634,2,NULL,16409,'Jupiter in Leo',NULL,'# Jupiter in Leo\n\nLeo brings out to the full the frank, expansive, exuberant nature of Jupiter, but the materializing influence of the Sun, as Lord of Leo, is felt markedly, and therefore the religious qualities of Jupiter are not very strong. In the case of Rudolph Steiner, the only definitely religious type on our list, Jupiter is very strong, being in the ninth house near the cusp of the Midheaven. The Leonine materiality of Jupiter&apos;s religious nature is shown very clearly in Brigham Young, who was more of a theocratic state-builder than a truly spiritual descendant of Joseph Smith. His Jupiter has the Sun, Venus, and Mercury sextile, all accentuating this influence of Leo; Uranus, too, is sextile on the other side, giving that touch of originality which has made Mormonism a living force.\n\nThe floridity of Jupiter in Leo is well illustrated by Wagner, Swinburne, and Caruso. The Jupiter of Wagner has Mars in opposition, Venus and the Sun in sextile and Mercury square; an ideal combination for the production of theatrical effect. Swinburne&apos;s Jupiter has Mars in conjunction, lending an extreme passion to the higher emotions, and a trine of Venus and Mercury rendering their expression harmonious, sensuous, and lucid. There is also, however, a direct opposition of Neptune to Jupiter which gives a strain of instability and lack of balance. It must not be forgotten that the great poet was also a bitter pamphleteer and a polemical critic. The voice of tenor Caruso is given romance and warmth by trines of his Leo Jupiter to a conjunction of Venus and Neptune on the fourth house cusp and to his Ascendant. It gets added strength from Mercury in the second house trine to Mars and conjunct the Sun.\n\nSimilar considerations apply to the Leo Jupiter of Huxley. We are to look here not for the science of the man, but for his religious feeling and his general outlook on life. Saturn and Venus are sextile, giving a sort of conscientious bonhomie, and the Moon and Pluto both trine Jupiter; Huxley&apos;s lectures promoting Darwin&apos;s theory of evolution helped introduce the fundamental shift (Pluto) to the public (Moon). A similar case is found in Arthur Balfour. As a statesman, Balfour was callous and caustic; but he was universally beloved in private life, even by his bitterest opponents. Pluto conjunct Uranus squared many of his planets, giving him ruthlessness, subtlety, a detached and superior attitude, and a bachelor&apos;s life, but the Sun and Venus in conjunction with Jupiter, and the Moon sextile, fully account for the radiant warmth and graciousness of his private interactions; and Jupiter&apos;s position on the cusp of the house of friends makes the effect even stronger.\n\nAs a contrast, consider Louis XVI, whose humanitarianism was so ill-suited to his period&mdash;Jupiter is conjoined with the Sun and Mercury, and their forces tend to overwhelm him. Some distant support, such as a trine, (or even the counter action of a square) seems always desirable to moderate the vehemence of a major conjunction. Henry VI was the Louis XVI of England. He, too, was tender hearted at the wrong time and place. His Jupiter has a rather distant trine of the Sun; but this may have developed his religious instincts and his gentleness. Some sterner element is valuable in the emotional apparatus of a king. The late J. Pierpont Morgan had Jupiter with Mars conjoined, Neptune in opposition, and Saturn nearly square on the other side. This restricts any great outpouring of the higher emotion; Jupiter is tied down very firmly to the material plane, but on that plane he is made very strong. He is externalized, as it were, to signify good fortune within the limits of the ambition.\n\nThe native with Jupiter in Leo is sincere, generous and magnanimous, ambitious, fond of power, often with much of the dramatic in his make-up, and usually well-fitted for success in public life. The position increases the intuition and strengthens the vitality, and it is most favorable for the development of such genius as may be indicated by the horoscope.\n\nThose born with Jupiter in Leo find any phase of work which requires subjection irksome and difficult. Such a nature could not possibly be happy in being a personal servant or a clerk behind the counter. He would be in perpetual revolt, and only those phases of work where some opportunity for command is possible, interest these personalities. Many officers of banks, directors and superintendents of important enterprises, captains of industry, and heads of departments are born with Jupiter in Leo. If circumstances over which these people have no control force them to fill inferior positions, they will not only find it almost impossible to adapt themselves to conditions, but they will be in danger of stirring the jealousy or enmity of their superiors. Furthermore, if they are in a subordinate position they may never know their latent possibilities; for until there is something great at stake, they will not be stirred to do their best and the powers lying dormant will not come to the surface.\n\nThose born with Jupiter in this sign have many generous impulses and inspire confidence in people of wealth or power; they naturally attract and enjoy much good fortune, provided they make use of their opportunities. They must, however, guard against going to extremes in the expenditure of money, particularly on friends or those they love.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

We, therefore, shall not expect to find here much expansion or altruism or even strong religious feeling. Petrarch may immediately strike the casual observer as an apparent exception to this rule, but he has Jupiter wonderfully developed by a sextile from Neptune, and a semi-sextile of the Sun and Mercury on one side and Saturn on the other, plus the Moon in Pisces closely opposes Jupiter. A more typical example, therefore, is Paul Kruger whose Jupiter has Mars in conjunction, Neptune in trine, and Venus only five degrees from exact conjunction. In this powerful complex, however, Mars, lord of the Ascendant, is the key, and Jupiter merely adds good fortune to Mars. Thus, while the religious and humanitarian nature was extremely strong, it remained strictly subservient to more important material forces.\n\nThe anarchist Vaillant had Saturn in conjunction with Jupiter, chilling him, Mercury square and Neptune in opposition, rendering his movements eccentric; Mars is sextile, denoting activity; hence the strong-headedness and strong-handedness of his essentially humanitarian impulses. Lord Brougham, cold-blooded lawyer, also has Jupiter in Virgo. The square of Uranus weakens the benignancy of Jupiter, while the sextile to a conjunction of Venus with Saturn constricts it into prudence; there is nothing to expand or fortify its benevolent impulses. The Jupiter of Bulwer-Lytton, on the other hand, has a sextile of Neptune, lending a mystical tendency, though not a very powerful or precise one, to the religious element, which is also made rather superficial by a square of Mercury. But Jupiter is strengthened by Saturn applying to a conjunction within twelve degrees; and, as Saturn is with Jupiter in the third house, his influences tinge the whole mind. Jupiter also forms a sextile to the Moon, rising on the Cancer Ascendant, which body is the key to the life of this novelist, historical writer, and politician.\n\nAlbrecht Dürer, saturnine though the austerity of his mind declares him, has yet a deep reverence. A conjunction of the Moon and Venus in Gemini squares Jupiter, and Uranus is semi-sextile, which increases the sociability and attraction to exotic technical matters. The Virgo influence, however, leaves some coldness. Sir Humphrey Davy, with Neptune in conjunction with Jupiter, Venus trine and Saturn sextile, is genuinely religious. Having taken laughing gas as an experiment, he came back from unconsciousness exclaiming &ldquo;Nothing exists but thoughts.&rdquo; The greatest saint in his highest trance could hardly have known much more. It is a striking example of a truly religious subconsciousness, in one whose conscious mind was preoccupied with the affairs of exact science.\n\nAlexandre Dumas has Jupiter conjoined with Venus and Saturn, semi-square to Mercury and opposing Pluto. From these influences comes the jovial raciness of his famous stories. Guy de Maupassant, hostile to religion his whole life, has Jupiter rising, in conjunction with Venus and Mars and with no help from Saturn, which is 150 degrees away (inconjunct); he is completely obsessed by this pair of passionate planets; and so we regretfully observe this brilliant author the slave of passions which ultimately slew him.\n\nThe materialistic qualities of Jupiter in Virgo tend to permeate the higher side of the mind in all directions, and the native is practical, analytical, and skeptical to the point of requiring proofs. Naturally, this position gives marked ability for scientific research, and generally for teaching and for service to others. It also, as in Taurus, gives great constructive power which may manifest itself in success in manufacturing, building, agriculture, or even in literature, according to the bent of the mentality.\n\nThose born with Jupiter in Virgo are exceedingly systematic; and, when they have this position, can carry on, with great force and precision, any phase of routine task which requires detail and persistence. They have pronounced technical command. They have two fields of activity open to them. Some of our most successful literary men, accountants, secretaries and teachers, as well as successful manufacturers, builders, miners, foresters, biologists and agriculturists were born with Jupiter in this sign.\n\nWomen having Jupiter in Virgo are successful in business life, or as librarians, private secretaries, teachers or in any position where practical, analytical, critical or constructive faculties are required.\n\nThe natural tendency to be constructive makes both men and women judicious in the expenditure of money, regardless of the income, and gives them a dislike for undue extravagance or waste. They make wise buyers.\n\nThey would do well to consider, as investments, real estate, mining property, manufacturing enterprises, or mortgages.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011636,2,NULL,16921,'Jupiter in Libra',NULL,'# Jupiter in Libra\n\nIn Libra, Jupiter encounters two apparently contradictory strains of influence, since Venus, Lady of the sign, softens or sentimentalizes the religious impulses, while Saturn, exalted in Libra, is able to give at least a tinge of asceticism. These influences blend, however, in developing sincerity in the religious instincts, which are expressed with an imaginative mysticism. The influence of Libra in itself contributes a sense of justice and impartiality. Therefore, the student of religions will not be surprised to learn that this sign held Jupiter at the nativities of Percy Bysshe Shelley, of Robert Louis Stevenson, of Swami Vivekananda, and of Maurice Maeterlinck. All these have the deepest religious instinct, combined with a sort of shrinking from the superficial facts of life, seeing humanity, as it were, through rose-colored glasses. It is the gentle spirit in these people which made them great. &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&rdquo; Jupiter in every case above cited is prominent in the nativity, but, at the same time, the tendencies of the sign account for what must at least be reckoned partial material failure.\n\nThe humanitarianism of Shelley was very strong. Mars is in conjunction with Jupiter, making the poet active in protest; but Neptune, also in conjunction, seriously weakens the effect by making his revolt fantastic and intermittent. Stevenson&apos;s Jupiter has not even so much strength. Saturn is in opposition, and there is nothing to help but a semi-sextile of Mercury. The gentle spirit is there, but it shows in a glow of kindliness, very lovable, but not to be feared by the unkindly-minded. The Jupiter of Swami Vivekananda is in all respects the best of the group. It is finely balanced by reason, and brought into action by will. A square of Venus prevents the mere sentimentality which her conjunction with the Sun might have allowed. Unfortunately, Mars is in opposition, or he might have made as successful a religious leader as Mohammed. Maeterlinck&apos;s Jupiter has the opposition of Neptune, which gives his religious nature its wonderful mysticism.\n\nConsider, now, a very ungentle spirit, but a great religious genius, Luther. Here Jupiter has Mars conjoined, with Uranus sextile and the Scorpio Sun exactly semi-sextile. Venus conjoins Saturn on the cusp of the fourth house, and Mercury conjoins Neptune, trine to the Aries Moon. There is a lever to move the world; there could be no question of resistance to a spiritual bolt of this caliber! Another great builder, genial enough in private life, but adamant in affairs of state, was Bismarck. Here Jupiter is opposed to the Sun and square to the Moon; Uranus, however, is sextile, and Mars and Saturn are in trine to Jupiter. The chief influence of Libra here is, doubtless, the sense of Justice and the balance which we have already noted as characteristic. Contrast with this the horoscope of Winston Churchill. Here Mars is in conjunction, making Jupiter powerful and energetic; but Neptune&apos;s opposition in this complex gives eccentricity. Jupiter acts vigorously, but by fits and starts; set-backs are certain to injure the career from time to time.\n\nJupiter in Libra favors comradeship and association in domestic affairs, especially where dispassionate judgment is a factor, and promises popularity. It gives especially good judgment in handling the money of others and impartiality in decisions; hence, judges and bankers are numerous among the natives of this position. It also promises success in occupations involving efficiency in the higher mathematics.\n\nThose born with Jupiter in Libra show a type of vocational interest where breadth of concept or even balance of judgment is of supreme worth. It is a position of such sensitiveness that rough, manual tasks or the stress of war would be most irksome. There is that type of personal balance and discrimination which might make the native a jeweler, a painter or a judge, but he could not be a butcher or a general. It gives a keen sense of justice and the ability to come to fair and just conclusions, even though adverse to their own personal interests. In fact, these people often show better judgment in the management of money belonging to others than in the management of their own, particularly if connected with speculation.\n\nFor this reason, unless circumstances seem very favorable, it would be well for them to be a part of a large organization or have a partner who has qualities which complement their own, rather than to be in business for themselves. Some of our most successful lawyers, judges, bankers, brokers, engineers, architects, electricians, as well as artists, are born with Jupiter in Libra. Therefore, any of the above professions or lines of business would prove more agreeable as a calling than anything purely commercial. If forced into the commercial world, they will feel dissatisfied, even though they meet with financial success. If they choose a hobby or an avocation, this will help to make their life seem more nearly complete.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011637,2,NULL,17177,'Jupiter in Scorpio',NULL,'# Jupiter in Scorpio\n\nSo powerful and so aggressive is Scorpio, that its influence in modifying any planet which comes into its &ldquo;war zone&rdquo; can hardly be estimated too highly. Mars and Jupiter make the most forceful combination of any two planets, and the Martial energy which Jupiter receives from the Lord of Scorpio is even more effective than that in Aries. For Jupiter is the Father of the Gods and has a strong creative instinct, while Scorpio is the sign of Sex. Hence, people with Jupiter in this sign have the religious idea developed to an overwhelming extent and indissolubly linked with that of generation. Whatever views may be generally held today as to religion, there is no doubt that the deepest reverence for the natural forces of creation makes for enormous strength, and especially for sincerity of religious conviction; since, in such a case, to deny one&apos;s own physical power is to fail in faith.\n\nIf Jupiter is strong in this sign, we find people with a positively fanatical faith in themselves. God is omnipotent, and He abides within them; how, then, can they ever falter on the path? The effect of ill-dignity&mdash;say an evil aspect to Jupiter from Saturn or Mercury&mdash;would be to upset the mental balance in this respect and to give evidence of deep-seated perversion.\n\nTo take such weak and perverse configurations before the others, we have two remarkable cases of what evidently amounts to sex-mania of a religious type. The case of Edith Allonby, who committed suicide in order to call attention to a book she had written, shows Saturn and Uranus square to Jupiter in Scorpio, one on either side, with Mercury, Mars, and Pluto also within orb, so that six planets are part of a Fixed Cross complex. All we know is that the publisher deemed editorial changes necessary so as not to offend the Christian reading public. On a grander scale, this type of religious hysteria is exhibited by Tolstoi. A conjunction of Venus and Saturn is square to Jupiter, but the sextile of Neptune adds a touch of mysticism intensified by Neptune&apos;s conjunction with Mars. Here is a case of a bad affliction transformed into exaltation and issuing in comparatively harmless channels; but it explains the argument for sexual abstinence in his censored novella &ldquo;The Kreutzer Sonata.&rdquo;\n\nWe find two instances in women of normal sex instincts raised to a high power and made useful in securing material advancement. The Jupiter of Nell Gwyn is trined by Mars, giving exceptional potency; while the Moon, also trine on the other side, adds a softness, which, in view of the strength given by Mars, is decidedly an advantage, especially as the square of Venus tends to prevent too great sentimentality. Cleo de Merode has the Sun and Venus semi-sextile to Jupiter and Neptune opposing; the Moon is sextile on one side, and Mars on the other. Each of these combinations is very strong and subtle.\n\nAmong writers with Jupiter in Scorpio, we see great preoccupation with, and insistence upon the importance of, the sex-nature. One need only quote Rossetti, Zola, Thomas Hardy, Alphonse Daudet, and Sainte Beuve. Rossetti&apos;s Jupiter, softened by the trine of Venus, and afflicted by the opposition of Mercury, becomes decidedly sensuous, while the will power is weakened by a square of Uranus. The sex-feeling is strong, but very feminine in quality; and the religious instinct is somewhat unsettled by this combination.\n\nVery different is the case of Zola, whose Jupiter, although trined by Venus, is redeemed by the closer trine of Uranus which is in conjunction with Venus; and, though the square of Neptune contributes mysticism, yet Jupiter remains extremely strong on the plane indicated; and creation, virility and constructiveness mark his feeling and his work. Venus, especially through her conjunction with Uranus, accounts for much of the animalism which has been criticized in his writing, but the Uranus-Jupiter trine elevates all this in the grand result. Indeed this case should be very instructive to the student, illustrating how each planet and aspect has its particular effect, persisting in spite of contrary aspects, and becoming reconciled in a higher complex. This principle is immensely important; it explains the infinite variety of mankind, and shows the folly of attempting the solution of astrological problems by mere consideration of the superficial elements of a horoscope.\n\nThomas Hardy&apos;s sex-religion complex very closely resembles Zola&apos;s. Here however, the Moon, instead of Venus, is trine to Jupiter; and, though Uranus is also in a wide trine, it is from the other side and not in a conjunction. It is a magnificent figure; but, unfortunately, as the Moon is rising in Cancer, the center of gravity tends toward her rather than to the greater planets, thus diminishing the intensity of both Jupiter and Uranus. Had Jupiter been in the ascendant, Hardy would have been much greater than Zola. The Jupiter of Alphonse Daudet has also the (wide) trine of Uranus; it is evidently a most important aspect for constructiveness. Neptune squares Jupiter and the Moon is semi-sextile. There is, therefore, not the same vivid direction to the force which we have seen in the previous cases. The Scorpio influence, however, is evident in dominating the Jupiter motive, while aspects to the Sun, Mars, and Uranus from Saturn on the Midheaven may be responsible for the touch of melancholy which one perceives in his mood.\n\nIn a much more heroic shape was molded the grand nativity of Napoleon. Jupiter is rising in the first house where he is the focus of a Kite pattern based on a Grand Earth Trine between Mars, Neptune, Uranus and Pluto. Uranus is in opposition, but a conjunction of Mars and Neptune is sextile. As the focus of this pattern, Jupiter benefits from the constructive insight of all three outer planets, plus Mars. It is not to be wondered at, that he had faith in his star. And here a word of explanation may be in place. This sublime self-confidence appearing to be a kind of insane egoism, it may be asked, &ldquo;Why not rather judge this quality from the point of Napoleon&apos;s Saturn?&rdquo; But it really is not fundamentally egotistic at all. Napoleon&apos;s belief was a true religious feeling; in him self-aggrandizement was a secondary matter; he quite seriously believed himself to be the divine instrument to right Europe, and that such a belief should take an apparently egoistic form involves no real change in its Jupiterian character.\n\nBenjamin Disraeli is another instance of a man who rose through an extreme belief in himself. Indeed, in his earlier days, he was much of a coxcomb. Here Neptune and Venus are both in conjunction with Jupiter, which, as with Napoleon, is on the Ascendant, giving just the fantastic affectation which distinguished him. A square from Saturn to Mercury prevented him from going too far on this line. The Moon and Mars, too, are square to Jupiter, and the result of this was a skeptical feeling in religion. Asked what his religion was, &ldquo;The religion of every sensible man.&rdquo; &ldquo;And what is that?&rdquo; &ldquo;No sensible man ever tells.&rdquo; Such an attitude is very characteristic of this aspect.\n\nFrom Scorpio&apos;s tendency to scientific investigation, Jupiter in this sign may sometimes have a very technical application to eminence in medicine and surgery, as in the case of Richard Quain. Jupiter is in the fourth house, trine to the Moon and Pluto. Saturn is exactly square. This doctor and medical lexicologist combined a deep concern for the common man with scholarly industry.\n\nAs an exception to the general implication of the sex-element in the religious idea, we have the mathematician Sir William Hamilton. But this is through no fault of Scorpio; it is the conjunction of Neptune that turns the religious instinct to metaphysics, and the square of Venus that neutralizes the sensual quality of the sign. The skeptical side remains, and is indeed accentuated by a near square of Mercury, who is Lord of the Ascendant. Mercury conjoins Venus, lending her some of that planet&apos;s asexual nature. This is a very interesting and instructive complex.\n\nIn music, we have two composers of the first rank in whom the sex-idea may be considered paramount, Strauss and Tchaikovsky. The latter has Neptune square to Jupiter, and Mars and the Sun in opposition, indicating the inversion of sex-impulse; but Uranus is trine, giving constructive ability, which the bad aspects also tend to transpose into a minor key. Strauss has a Jupiter of greater power; he is in the house of pleasure where he is aspected by Pluto and the Sun.\n\nFrom all the cases cited, it will appear that Jupiter in Scorpio indicates an active, self-confident mind, well centered upon its object, with much perseverance and generous enthusiasm. The position is favorable for success in engineering and chemistry and also for matters of transportation, especially marine. Many surgeons, dentists, machinists and railroad officials are found among those born under this combination.\n\nWhile the imagination and the emotional nature are strengthened, the native will be extremely fond of pleasure and have not a little of showiness in his personality.\n\nThose born with Jupiter in Scorpio would be well qualified for a general or for anyone like, let us say, a detective; they are interested in all subtle, secret and exact forms of activity. They would not delight in an open, jolly, offhand type of work, such as travelling salesmanship. These people are very tenacious in the attainment of their desires and ambitions, whether they be for power in the financial, artistic, or social world. They have a great sense of self-protection, but must guard against being too self-absorbed. Scorpio is the sign of great extremes, and can either make one very spiritual and unselfish or very material. It is, therefore, necessary that those who have Jupiter so placed live up to their best, as well as to the letter of the law. Many successful critics, musicians, chemists, and those engaged in mechanical pursuits, as well as officials in large organizations, have Jupiter in Scorpio.\n\nWomen with Jupiter in this sign often make magnetic healers, nurses, masseuses and dentists, or attendants in physicians&apos; offices.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Even so, we need not expect to find a very genial Jupiter, for Sagittarius is dry as well as swift.\n\nThe most expansive persons illustrative of this position are Edward VII and President Faure of France. The former has Jupiter very well placed, only six degrees above the eastern horizon, and with a sextile of Venus. The square of Uranus accounts for the fact that a good deal of his joviality led to scandal. Felix Faure had this same square of Uranus to Jupiter; scandalous behavior with a woman led directly to his death; the details may be seen in Venus, the ruler of his eighth house, being near that Uranus and in square to Saturn. A sextile from Neptune and the Sun is no help, and Jupiter, being in the second house, is not so powerful as in the case of the founder of the Triple Entente.\n\nLily Langtry&apos;s Jupiter is in the third house, but it has no bad aspects except a rather distant square of Neptune. The Sun is sextile, exactly; and, as he is Lord of the eleventh house, one can see how much the friendship of exalted persons must have meant in her career. The Jupiter of Queen Elizabeth I is very strong by position, being just above the Orient. But he is afflicted by a square of the Sun and another of Neptune, while Mars is in opposition. Mercury is sextile, but this only signified the exploitation of Jupiter by shrewdness. From a moral point of view, the afflictions are about as bad as it is possible to imagine.\n\nIn the giant figure of Cecil Rhodes, the square of Neptune to Jupiter may perhaps have aided the trine of Neptune to the Sun, making him spiritual and large-ideaed, while the sextile and trine of Pluto to the Moon and Mercury made those ideas deep and well-conceived. Sagittarius without doubt lent a fierce impetuosity to their development. A similarly ambitious, though selfish, example is Robespierre. The great ability is shown plainly by the trine of Mars to Jupiter, but Pluto is conjunct, adding ruthlessness. Neptune is close to Mars, and contributes wildness. Uranus, again, is nearly square to both Jupiter and Pluto. We cannot call this Jupiter weak; indeed, he is placed at the Midheaven, and doubtless the &ldquo;sea-green incorruptible&rdquo; was extremely adroit in making use of his friends, but there is nothing to bring out the naturally noble qualities of Jupiter.\n\nSince Sagittarius is a peculiarly mysterious influence, the mystical side of the religious instinct may sometimes be strongly developed. From a psychic standpoint, its influence is even better&mdash;and far less liable to corruption&mdash;than that of Pisces. Polygamist Joseph Smith was without doubt a truly religious man, however little one may feel inclined to subscribe to, or even to examine seriously, his strange belief. Here Saturn and Uranus are conjoined sextile to Jupiter on the one side, and Venus is closely sextile to Jupiter on the other. There is a semi-sextile of Mercury. These healthy aspects give a most powerful development of the religious impulse; it is clear that the most sincere conviction went with his belief, and that this intense and honest passion was the real lever that moved so many of his contemporaries to endure the most sinister persecutions for their faith.\n\nW. B. Yeats is a visionary of lesser caliber, though of more intellectual power. Saturn and the Moon are sextile to his Jupiter in the eleventh house, but Uranus and the Sun are in opposition. This productive complex is now called a Kite pattern, where Jupiter in Sagittarius becomes the focus planet for a Grand Air Trine. The focus planet of a pattern is emphasized in the native&apos;s life such that one can profitably study both its house and sign. Yeats was a gregarious Nobel-prize winning poet and dramatist who also found time to be a mystic, astrologer, theatre director, and senator. In addition to his Jupiter Kite pattern, he had another complex involving Venus conjunct Pluto square to Mars, which trined mystic Neptune; sexual liaisons played an important role, especially towards the end of life. It is a straightforward chart for the astrologer to understand.\n\nMelanchthon, who, from the purely religious side, was a greater element in the development of Protestantism than Luther himself, has his Jupiter strengthened by the conjunction of Mars. The conjunction is part of a Grand Fire Trine involving the Moon and Saturn, which conjoins Venus. Uranus is sextile and Jupiter has a wide square to the Sun which itself is sextile to Neptune. It is a big and genuine complex; and, as in the case of Joseph Smith, the moral earnestness of the man was a tremendous asset. Few would have trusted the volcanic Luther alone, but nobody could have doubted Melanchthon; this retiring scholar had Virgo rising and his Pisces Sun occupied the sixth house of service. Such men, in themselves often without initiative, are the backbone, or perhaps the heart, of every great religious movement. Woe to the man of brains who cannot find a man of heart to back him!\n\nAnd such again was William Blake, one of the truest and noblest seers that England had produced up to that time. The conjunction of the Sun and Mercury with Jupiter assures the intensity and fervor of true faith. Neptune rising with Mars is the focus of an Arrow Yod pattern from Venus, Saturn, and Uranus; this impractical planet is the dominant force in the element of vision, however, the Jupiter complex affects the definitely religious connection with the vision. Saturn being in opposition to Neptune gives greater importance to Jupiter, because the selfish instinct is repressed and spiritualized, thus leaving the expansive qualities to develop at will.\n\nIt is doubtful if any of the signs promise more favorably for Jupiter&apos;s influence upon financial prosperity than does Sagittarius. Its natives seldom hold subordinate positions, being natural financiers; they are fortunate as directors or managers of large enterprises. It gives a generous disposition and brings honor and esteem not only from friends but even from enemies.\n\nThose born with Jupiter in Sagittarius would find sympathetic any sphere of work where clear, penetrating, intellectual precision would produce essential success. A mere social task or emotional occupation, or a material routine kind of work would prove distasteful. These people are natural financiers, and if in a subordinate position, or if forced to deal in small figures, will never get the full benefit of their &ldquo;luck.&rdquo; It is so much a part of their destiny to have money and to do everything in a princely way, that, if they force themselves to economize and to save the pennies, they will so change their nature that they will cut themselves off from what would otherwise come to them. Jupiter in this position frequently brings money, through inheritance, and because people of influence, wealth and power have confidence in the judgment of those who have it so placed. These people just naturally attract much good fortune, and, unless they neglect opportunities, they will meet with unusual success and be a power in their world.\n\nWomen with Jupiter in this sign are rarely forced to be self-supporting, but, if desirous of earning money, they can be successful in some enterprise of their own, or as advisors, directors, and financial managers.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Jupiter badly aspected may become the demon of debauch. This is evidently the case with Oscar Wilde, in whose case the legend of Ganymede may be remembered.\n\nWilde&apos;s Jupiter is squared by the Sun, which is apt to make its influence loose and gross, and the trine of Uranus and sextile of Neptune can give no counterbalance to such impulses, for these rather tend to accentuate so-called perversions. Jupiter, too, is in the house of pleasures, allowing the full development of the sensual side of his nature; and we have seen that Venus in Libra tends to strange refinements of the sex life. It is, taking it altogether, a most unfortunate position. The Scottish poet Robert Burns was born with Jupiter rising in Capricorn with the only aspect a semi-sextile to a conjunction of Venus and Mars in Aquarius; he created a reputation for dissolute behavior by fathering numerous illegitimate children through casual love affairs. But as a poet he wrote of the humble characters that he knew from his own difficult farm background and worked to collect traditional Scottish folk songs, some of which provided the tunes for his own poetic songs, such as Auld Lang Syne.\n\nWe have one great visionary, Swedenborg, with this position of Jupiter, and the material character of his visions is no doubt due to this. No man ever went so far in bringing angels to earth; his heaven is as objective as that of the orthodox Christian; indeed, more so, because it is more detailed. No man was ever less mystic in the true sense of the word, or held together more firmly the bonds of spirit and matter. Uranus, in conjunction with the Moon, is trine to Jupiter; and here the Moon stands for materiality, while Uranus gives the illumination and the originality. A touch of the fleshy may be conferred by Venus rising twelve degrees above Jupiter, who, as the Lord of the Ascendant, is certainly the key of the complex.\n\nKarl Marx, who made the study of large-scale economies his life&apos;s work, had this Jupiter trine to a conjunction of the Sun and Moon in both the sign and house of money; and there is a constructive sextile to Saturn, in idealistic Pisces, where Saturn itself squares revolutionary Uranus. As the sign of the tenth house Capricorn can assume a responsible stewardship role as opposed to the personal pleasure emphasis that we saw with Cancer. Whatever you say about Marxian economics, he was working for the greater good. The philosopher and psychologist William James, who struggled with paralysis of the will and depression in his personal life, has Jupiter near a conjunction of Saturn and Venus, sextile to Mars in Pisces; he also has Sun and Moon conjunct in Capricorn. He found relief from his Capricorn seriousness in &lsquo;acting as if he had free will&rsquo;, which astrologically corresponded to energizing his Mars-Jupiter sextile.\n\nIt is extremely interesting to observe through such cases, how, in every complex, the key dominates the entire configuration on the large scale, and yet how every single aspect insists upon achieving its own special signification. The position gives a curiously paradoxical combination of shrewd economy and extravagance; the native being apt to be parsimonious in small matters and to spend liberally in large amounts. Many successful merchants and manufacturers are found with this position; and, of course Capricorn endows Jupiter with fortunate influences in any occupation connected with the earth.\n\nThose born with Jupiter in Capricorn have an enormous capacity for detail and routine and are conscientious plodders. They make successful manufacturers, wholesale clothiers, builders, real estate dealers, miners, agriculturists and foresters.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

His religious side is, however, not strongly developed, though there may be a tendency to uncommon religious beliefs of a mystical or occult nature. In general, however, political astuteness is far more to the front in Jupiter&apos;s activity, as is witnessed by Queen Victoria and Caesar Borgia, whose careers, despite the difference of their eras, are not altogether unlike. The sextile of Mars from Aries assures the efficiency of Victoria&apos;s Jupiter; he culminates in the tenth house, and there is no trace of any aspect from a planet to disturb his political bent. The real character of Caesar Borgia is not altogether unlovable. The Sun is trine to Jupiter, making him open and scornful of meanness, but Mars and Saturn in conjunction oppose Jupiter, and these aspects doubtless brought his ultimate ruin.\n\nAnother interesting comparison involves George Eliot and John Ruskin. The same coldness is apparent in both. In the former, a sextile of Venus to Jupiter tends to loosen the conventional ties, and the opposition of Mars must have been a great handicap. But in this complex, Mars, as Lord of the Ascendant, is the important factor, especially as he is near the cusp of the Midheaven, and Jupiter is in a subordinate position. John Ruskin&apos;s Jupiter is seriously afflicted by a conjunction of Mars and by the opposition of the Moon to both these planets; and, the Moon being in the sixth house, an actual physical defect was apparently the cause of his physical incapacity. But had Jupiter not been in zero of Aquarius, taking on some of the coldness of Capricorn, the calamity of the aspects might not have been so serious.\n\nColeridge&apos;s Jupiter was squared by Uranus and opposed by the Moon; fortunately, however, the Sun is nearly trine. Observe how each of these has its own peculiar effect. Jupiter, Lord of the Ascendant, is the key to the complex; and, as he is rising (though rather low in the second house), the personality is altogether suffused with expansive, generous, and noble religious instincts. But Uranus makes his character rather original (to our profit, indeed, though to the poet&apos;s own material detriment) and turns it into unusual channels. The weird horror of the one great poem and the two fragments by which he lives in literature are admirably suggested by this aspect plus the Lunar opposition. The trine of his Libra Sun is yet deeper and more personal; it is the undertow of his thought to love all. Hence all the fantastic and gruesome imagery of the Ancient Mariner only decorates the simple truth:\n\n&ldquo;He prayeth best, who loveth best,\n\nAll things both great and small.&rdquo;\n\nIt is a noble, unfortunate complex, highly instructive to the student, and it operates on every plane. Jupiter afflicted by Uranus in the house of pleasure squared by the Moon could only mean, on the physical side, addiction to drugs.\n\nJupiter in Aquarius gives to the native sincere friends who bring both benefit and pleasures. It strengthens the intuition, inclines to originality in ideas, and favors the acquirement and development of almost any of the higher mental qualities. It gives little love for money as such, and great sensitiveness to the material needs of others. Its natives develop as physicians, lecturers, teachers and promoters of large schemes, especially when they are of a philanthropic kind.\n\nThose born with Jupiter in Aquarius enjoy all phases of work relating to human beings. It is a splendid position for diplomats, labor leaders, psychologists, sociologists, and for those types of business men or women who handle many employees. In a business way, these people often prove more fortunate to others than to themselves, and for this reason they should hesitate before assuming the responsibility of conducting a business of their own; they would do better by being part of a large organization or in an advisory capacity. If they are following a profession, they would do well to have a competent secretary who will look after the financial end in a businesslike manner; otherwise, because of their leniency, they are likely to suffer from delinquent accounts or from attracting too many clients who take advantage of their humanitarianism. Many competent physicians, architects, inventors, bankers, brokers, ambassadors, statesmen, lecturers and teachers, as well as promoters of big schemes, particularly of a philanthropic kind, or where the object is to improve the general condition of the masses, have Jupiter thus placed. They are often bored by ordinary commercial business; and, if forced into this channel, they should also have a hobby or other interest, in order that their life may be complete.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

For example, in the case of Colonel Olcott, a sextile of Neptune is Jupiter&apos;s only important aspect; this, perhaps, led him to Theosophy rather than to Presbyterianism. In the case of Nietzsche, his Jupiter is conjunct the 4th house of home&mdash;his Lutheran pastor father gave him a religious upbringing, but Mars on the Midheaven dominates and opposes the gentle Jupiter in Pisces. Nietzsche posited the Übermensch (Superman) as a goal for humanity, saying &ldquo;man is something which ought to be overcome.&rdquo;\n\nTom Mann, the socialist agitator, has this position of Jupiter. Apart from near conjunctions of Venus and Neptune, there is no aid, and Saturn is square. It is a bad and selfish as well as a weak and untrustworthy complex.\n\nWe have, however, three really great men with this position. Each has the true religious feeling; yet, in each case, it is somewhat masked by the scientific spirit. Herbert Spencer, for example, has no aspects to Jupiter but the wide sextile of the Sun, the semi-sextile of Mercury and wide square of Venus. It is by far the weakest of his three great complexes. Goethe has Neptune trine to Jupiter; hence the mystical tinge in his religious thought, and Venus is in opposition. Saturn rising is within ten degrees of making a triple trine with the two former planets, and adds a much-to-be desired severity to the mind. The Venus aspect here only insists on beauty of form, and no doubt determined him as primarily a poet. Sir Isaac Newton has Saturn conjoined to Jupiter, lending wisdom and austerity to his religious conceptions, while the Sun is sextile, illuminating the vision and balancing by his warmth the coldness of Saturn. Uranus, moreover, is trine, giving originality and freedom to the idea. It is an altogether admirable combination, one of the finest that we have had to consider.\n\nJupiter in Pisces indicates travel, principally by water, and brings good fortune through occupations ruled by Neptune. It inclines the disposition to be kind, quiet and unassuming. It develops the social instincts, but is apt to leave the native rather easy going and unambitious, unless the planet is well-dignified.\n\nThose born with Jupiter in Pisces would be bored if obliged to confine their efforts to any mere intellectual type of work; emotion, human association, drama and responsiveness must enter into the vocational interests. Because of their ability to cooperate with their associates, they succeed when connected with large manufacturing concerns; they are also successful in a business connected with steamship companies, waterways or those concerned with liquids. Those engaged in research work for the benefit of humanity, secretarial workers, teachers, orators, dramatists, actors and dancers are frequently born with Jupiter in this sign.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

It is not that the martial disposition of the sign is so unfavorable; but Aries is the sign par excellence of initiative, and to find delay in that which is essentially of prompt decision is fatal. The Sun, too, being exalted in Aries, can hardly rejoice to find his brilliance usurped by the dull planet, his joy replaced by that leaden melancholy. However, Saturn is obstinate enough, and when in this sign, he appears to mean that the will is working under great disadvantages; it represents persistent struggle against overwhelming obstacles. It means usually patience; but if success comes to the native, it can only be at the end of the journey, and that with pain and sorrow. There seems no right adaptation possible of the means available to his end&mdash;the native is indeed a round peg in a square hole. He must take courage that all experience is for the good of the soul, and so miss no spiritual profit. Circumstances prove usually too much for the sturdiness of the personality. Even those who achieve greatness are likely to miss full measure, because Fate seems to say &ldquo;thus far and no further.&rdquo;\n\nAn example of such restriction to effort is the poet Philip Bourke Marston&apos;s blindness. His Moon, one of the &ldquo;lights,&rdquo; is in Scorpio, in opposition to a conjunction of Uranus and Pluto, which are only 9 degrees from Saturn. The Rising Sun is in trine to Saturn, and Marston seems to have made splendid use of the Sun&apos;s reinforcement and found strength to make headway against his misfortune. His case seems especially one caused by the soul&apos;s election of special discipline&mdash;for the unfavorable aspect of Luna indicates calamity beyond prevention.\n\nThe world will not soon forget Robert Louis Stevenson&apos;s heroic cheer and industry under the lash and inescapable grind of physical suffering. What might his pen have wrought unhampered! Yet the discipline and &ldquo;trying out&rdquo; of his fine soul counts on the side of eternal profit and, though the physical man could not surmount the affliction of ill-health, and an early death cut short his effort, yet his courage and cheer were never dimmed, and &ldquo;pity&rdquo; must hesitate to judge. Saturn rising, afflicted by the opposition of Jupiter, and the Sun in conjunction with Mars, with Neptune rising in conjunction with Luna, and Chiron at the Midheaven trine Saturn, indicate his test. Who shall compute or deny his eternal profit?\n\nThe limiting power of Saturn in Aries worked out similarly through the ill health that handicapped Herbert Spencer. Here, however, is a formidable personality and a will capable of overcoming anything and everything; although a persistent invalid, he not only accomplished his gigantic task, but lived to great age. Uranus and Neptune are rising in conjunction, square to Pluto and Chiron, which are within seven degrees of Saturn in Aries; the Moon and Sun in opposition and squared by Mars is unfortunate, but Saturn, semi-sextile to Sol and trine to Mars, influences baleful but strengthening balance. The Will of the man tips the scales, and the Will of Spencer pulled with Neptune and Uranus, and set patience, courage and concentrated industry in the balance. Materially, he &ldquo;beat&rdquo; fate with success. But who shall compute his greater riches, won under the discipline of his Saturn in Aries?\n\nSir Richard Burton&apos;s obstacle is external. His ill-health was caught in the jungles. His Moon is directly opposed by his Saturn in Aries, which is conjoined with Mercury, lord of the house of his friends. Jupiter too is with Saturn. Burton displays indomitable courage, yet cannot counteract the limitation of his Moon. His walls of success fall as fast as he lays the stones.\n\nThe Saturn of Erasmus spoke limitation from Aries, though enlightened by Uranus, opposite in fair Libra. We find Erasmus the foremost scholar of his time, and his limitation represented by that time. Patient, persevering, indomitable, he seems to have laid hold upon the steadfastness of Saturn and accomplished the utmost possible&mdash;but the bar could not be lifted.\n\nInescapable limitation is manifested curiously in the career of famed artist Rosa Bonheur, whose sex shackles her. Sturdily she laid hold of all that Saturn trined by Mars could give. She never faltered in purpose and we know the splendid measure of her success.\n\nGuy de Maupassant succumbs to the forces of his own emotional nature. His Venus is rising in conjunction with Mars and Jupiter. This is the test that seems dictated by Saturn in Aries and de Maupassant seemed unable to lay hold on any reinforcement to his will. Lamentable indeed was the climax of that most brilliant and most unfortunate life!\n\nWe end the series with Charles Baudelaire. Saturn is in conjunction with the Sun; Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter are all approaching them. Obstacle and limitation and powers of opposition! And also an array of strengthening influences to equip him in the fight to which the soul is called. All these planets, however, are in the eighth house the house of death. His preoccupation was ever with death and the appurtenances and ornaments of death. His Uranus and Neptune are conjoined exactly in the fourth house, inviting an inner solemnity to the soul.\n\nThe poet walks in his garden of cypress, and tends his monkshood, his nightshade, and his vervain&mdash;darkness and sorrow his limitation! Not for him the blossoms of the May, nor the rose-bowers of happier though not holier bards! The edict of Saturn in Aries is fulfilled.\n\nFrom all the cases cited it appears that Saturn in Aries tends to bring the native prominently forward in his own sphere of activity; he has ambition, is diplomatic, though somewhat distrustful, and has self-confidence, though he may be austere and a lover of retirement. With many acquaintances, he has few intimates, and there may be traces of selfishness and sometimes great irritability. One of the greatest limitations imposed by Saturn in Aries is upon the physical health. Such material success as may be obtained is likely to be through the relations with the public.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

But as all this makes for steadiness, the moral character is firm and capable of overcoming obstacles by sheer determination; while, on the other hand, those obstacles themselves are not apt to be particularly violent. So we shall expect to find natives with the capacity to push steadfastly forward, and to conquer.\n\nOne of the weakest examples of this position is given by Shelley, whose Saturn, being in only two degrees of Taurus, retains perhaps some portion of the Aries qualities. It has little support from the other planets, although it trines Mercury in Virgo and opposes Neptune in late Libra. Hence we see in Shelley, a moral instability, which is contrary to the general nature of Saturn in Taurus; he has fine aspirations, given by the Sun, Venus and Uranus in conjunction, without the power to fully coordinate them or cause them to cohere; impatience and frivolity indicated by Mars and Neptune in conjunction with Jupiter&mdash;from the effects of which an iron and indomitable resistance would have saved him.\n\nThe nativities of three great conquerors present an utterly different picture. It was the military genius of Grant that turned the fortunes of the Civil War, and Grant had Saturn rising on the cusp of Taurus in conjunction with the Sun and Jupiter and trined by a conjunction of Neptune and Uranus. There is a close semi-sextile to Pluto. An astrologer looking at this horoscope might easily have predicted the famous words, &ldquo;I propose to fight it out on this line, if it takes all summer.&rdquo;\n\nSimilar doggedness is shown by Cecil Rhodes whose Saturn has the sextile of Venus and is only ten degrees from the conjunction of Mars. The figure is not so strong as Grant&apos;s, and one cannot be surprised that he died saying &ldquo;So much to do; so little done.&rdquo; But the patience and moral force of the man are not in doubt; it was the inertia of the Sun and Moon in Cancer that hindered him from more complete success.\n\nThe third example is Alexander the Great. Here Saturn is sextile to the Sun, trine to Jupiter and Neptune, and semi-sextile to Pluto, an ideal disposition for a great conqueror. Only the most concentrated patience and steadiness of push could have carried him through into India; an expedition, by the way, which would appear hopeless for a modern army of any size, with all the advantages of railways. His name is still known and honored throughout Persia and North India; his is an example of Saturn in Taurus at his best.\n\nTwo of the most patient observers that science can claim are Alfred Russell Wallace and Louis Pasteur. The Saturn of the former is trined by Uranus and Neptune; but closely squared by Mars; without that detriment he might have been as great as Huxley or Darwin. Pasteur has no such trouble; with the Sun, Uranus, Neptune, Mercury and Venus, all in conjunction, trine to Saturn, it is no wonder that he became the foremost of the men of science of France. There could be no doubt or wavering in a Saturn so brilliantly aspected.\n\nIn mundane affairs Saturn in Taurus is not very good for financial matters; unless extremely well aspected, money comes slowly or wastes away. The native, however, may somewhat counteract this danger, since the same influence that begrudges his financial success makes him careful and saving, sometimes indeed quite frugal. In all cases there is apt to be some selfishness.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

But the intellectuality of Gemini is inspirational, rather like a child&apos;s; while that of Saturn is the wisdom of age and experience. When both sign and planet are dignified, the combination is superb. In any case, however, the native is out of the region of patient effort and struggle; with Saturn in Gemini the character of the action is removed to the mental plane.\n\nConsider the chart of Italian poet Dante Alighieri. Mercury conjoins Saturn in Gemini, with a conjunction from Jupiter in Taurus to assist Saturn, which is in the Ascendant. Saturn opposes the Moon which affects the mind&apos;s temperament, with its trend toward melancholy; he found solace only in dreams. However, a sextile from Mars to Saturn is sufficient to strengthen the character and make it patient in its afflictions; the scholarship and labor involved in his &ldquo;Divine Comedy,&rdquo; begun and completed while he ate the bitter bread of exile, are hardly to be conceived, still less appreciated, in an age like the present.\n\nAnother very great man with this position, equally somber, is Albrecht Dürer, whose &ldquo;Melancholia&rdquo; inspired James Thomson (B.V.) to one of the greatest masterpieces of literature, &ldquo;The City of Dreadful Night.&rdquo; Dürer is one of the most austere and pure draftsmen that ever took pencil in hand; austere Pluto squares his Sun; but the Sun and Mercury being in conjunction with Saturn in the tenth house, the point of view is broader and there is in him less pure melancholy than in Dante.\n\nSometimes Saturn may quite overpower Gemini, and give merely a stubborn mind. Such is the case with Paul Kruger, whose Saturn, being closely squared by the Moon, has no trace of idealism. The trine of the Sun adds great moral strength and pertinacity, and the opposition of Pluto to Mercury helps to confer great shrewdness. Gemini is only evidenced by the childlike innocence with which he was wont to mask his astuteness, and by the fact that the action of his Saturn took effect in the fields of diplomacy.\n\nThe great Copernicus had Saturn in Gemini fortified by a trine from Mars in Aquarius and a square from Pluto in Virgo, which gave him the mental independence and stubbornness to achieve a revolution in our view of the solar system.\n\nStubborn, too, was George III, who lost America by his mulishness. Here Venus and Neptune are both conjoined with the leaden planet, a very unfortunate combination, making his temperament eccentric and unaccountable, and turning persistence into obstinacy, and moral force into pig-headedness. Pluto is trine, and Mercury, too, is conjoined, or the result should have been even more disastrous; he might have lost his throne; as it was, he lost his reason.\n\nThe case of Oscar Wilde is very unfortunate. Here Saturn in the Midheaven is squared by Neptune; the moral character is ruined by eccentricity. With all his splendid qualities given by the sextile of the Moon and the trine of the Sun, he was doomed to catastrophe.\n\nNell Gwyn and Lily Langtry had very similar careers in that each enjoyed the friendship and confidence of a king. In both cases Saturn is strong; Nell Gwyn has the trine of the Sun and the opposition of Uranus and Neptune, and Lily Langtry&apos;s Saturn is elevated, opposed by Venus in Scorpio and squared by the Moon with Neptune from the fifth house; in her case, the Sun sextiles Jupiter. The cases are interesting as showing purpose and resolute ambition working with Neptunian cleverness to attain their ambition.\n\nA strong Gemini Saturn can be seen in the Scottish satirical writer Thomas Carlyle; in his chart Saturn is in opposition to the Sun, in trine to Jupiter, and in square to Uranus. An essayist, historian, and teacher, he is responsible for labeling economics &ldquo;the dismal science.&rdquo;\n\nSaturn in Gemini in many cases indicates trouble or hardships in the early life, such being often connected with the education or literary work. It naturally follows from the nature of the planet and sign that such success as is gained should come through intellectual matters.

It is indolent to a degree, and saps the morality of Saturn. His persistence degenerates into laziness, and his austere concentration into mere inertia. Notwithstanding the galaxy of great names whose nativities show Saturn in this sign, which might lead the careless student to assume the position a fortunate one, the exceptions to this rule will be found few, and a careful study of the cases cited will prove that the successes were not because of, but in spite of Saturn&apos;s detriment in Cancer.\n\nWe have as examples of this position a trio of amazing geniuses in literature and art&mdash;Shakespeare, Balzac, and, to a lesser degree, Rossetti. But Saturn&apos;s influence, so far from contributing anything to the greatness of these men, was not by all their good aspects prevented from achieving on each an effect that may not unfairly be described as debauching. Their conscience was manifest only in the sphere of their work; the famous epigram of Catullus may be reversed for them. In their lives they were extravagant and idle; pleasure made them slaves. No sooner was the work of the moment over than they plunged into dissipation.\n\nThe Saturn of Shakespeare was in conjunction with Jupiter. Neptune is in conjunction with Venus and in exact opposition to Uranus. The astrologer will be in little doubt as to the significance of the much-debated sonnets, or disposed to whitewash the carousals at the &ldquo;Mermaid.&rdquo; He will not be surprised at the accurate drawing of the Falstaff scenes, or be bewildered by the exquisite ambiguity of Rosalind and Viola.\n\nThe Saturn of Balzac, afflicted by a conjunction of Venus and Mars in Cancer, has no assistance but a wide sextile of Uranus. While free of perversions, it is evident how these positions led him into excess and careless extravagances.\n\nRossetti&apos;s Saturn has an opposition from Mars and Neptune in Capricorn. From this we see how, in spite of his great genius, anger and whimsy interfered with his proper concentration, how idleness and folly ate up his soul, demoralizing the good of a trine of the Sun to Neptune and Mars, and found their culmination in madness.\n\nFor yet another example we may take Queen Elizabeth I, whose policy was much marred by her pursuit of pleasure. Here Saturn, in conjunction with Uranus, is squared by Mercury, which is made powerful by a trine from Mars, making her temper eccentric and unreliable, in spite of a sextile from the Sun, which could only save her from going to too great extremes. It was not strong enough to counteract the danger of sensuality of Saturn in Cancer, and the title of &ldquo;England&apos;s Virgin Queen&rdquo; requires quotation marks.\n\nIn the case of Napoleon, Saturn is far stronger, not only because he is culminating, but also because Libra, the Ascendant, is the sign of his exaltation. The opposition of the Moon in Capricorn is not therefore so powerfully unfavorable. With Sun and Mercury in Leo, and many favorable aspects to austere Pluto, his moral character was developed well enough for self-restraint against his propensities, although of course he was in some ways as sensual as those already considered. But he never allowed pleasure to interfere with his ambition. Note well, however, that Saturn took his revenge upon the body, since his loss of the battles of Leipzig and of Waterloo came largely through his illness, by reason of indigestion, and he died from a cancer of the stomach, an organ that is ruled by this sign.\n\nIn the case of Nostradamus, we have Saturn dominating the nativity in the fullest sense. He is in the third or fourth house in conjunction with Mars and Jupiter and exactly trined by the Moon, which dignities easily overcome all the lax tendencies of the Cancer position. The planet of gaiety, Venus, forms a sextile to austere Pluto. We have here a fine picture of the famous astrologer&mdash;sinister, severe, pious, noble, commanding austerity dominant in his manner, and vision in his eyes. Neptune elevated in the tenth or eleventh house, opposing Saturn and Mars, completes the sketch, adding a certain aloofness to the character, and causing incredible stories to gather around his name like demons about the circle of an enchanter.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

The effect of this antipathy will vary according to the dignity as usual. It may mean sorrow to the heart of the native, where he is passive to its influence, or a constriction in his own emotion. When under adverse aspects, he receives it actively. The currents of the blood are then frozen; there is apt to be a critical and cold outlook on life, and the sentiment it gives is tinged with diplomacy. The native is skeptical of compliments or attentions bestowed on him by others. However, it must be said that these natives are attracted to the spotlight, playing the larger-than-life role of the hero, or even the heroine, as Annie Oakley attests.\n\nThe greatest name we find in this position is that of Tolstoi, whose Saturn in the second house on the cusp of Leo still holds some trace of Cancer, and is also excited by the conjunction of Venus. The opposition by Uranus in Capricorn in the eighth house gives more than just mystic sight&mdash;the emotional nature is warped and distorted and turned to morbidity by the Saturn influence further corrupted by Venus; hence his &ldquo;Kreutzer Sonata,&rdquo; as well as his attitude toward his wife and family.\n\nAn example of Saturn in Leo at his worst is given by Franz Josef of Austria, where the planet is afflicting a conjunction of the Sun and the Moon. The Emperor&apos;s nature was doubtless itself somewhat callous, Pluto is angular on the Descendant and square Jupiter, but the Saturnian influence is most seen in the repeated mattock-blows of fate that struck him. King Lear is .a very petty figure of tragedy beside Franz Josef. In this nativity, Saturn&apos;s conjunction with the Sun and the Moon is in the eleventh, the house of hopes and of friends. That the two luminaries become the slayers seems to indicate that the conjunction of Saturn is peculiarly fatal to the New Moon, and a further deadliness may be conferred by the influence of the fixed star Regulus, martial and strident, close to whom the conjunction occurs. Saturn&apos;s only aid is a semi-sextile of Venus, quite powerless against such afflictions. We are the more inclined to attribute the catastrophes of the Emperor&apos;s life to the Regulus influence, when we remember that the outbreak of the great war occurred when Mars was rising at the solstice in conjunction with Regulus, and the eclipse following had the Sun and Moon exactly on that spot.\n\nKaiser Wilhelm II, has Saturn in opposition to the Sun and both square to Pluto, but Saturn is in sextile to Jupiter, who therefore also trines the Sun; he has enjoyed far better fortune, in spite of the loss of his kingdom and the downfall of all his hopes.\n\nA great example of the influence of Saturn in Leo, making its native cold and calculating in matters of the heart is found in Brigham Young, who revoked membership for blacks in the Mormon priesthood, but who had 55 wives and 56 children. In his case an opposition of the Moon increases the coldness of the outlook. As far as his polygamy goes, note expansive Jupiter in Leo conjunct Mars in Cancer, and also Pluto square Venus.\n\nCaesar Borgia is a case of a violent yet cold disposition, at once cynical and of ungovernable passion. Here Saturn opposed by Jupiter, is in conjunction with Mars, which is warmed by a semi-sextile of Venus and a sextile of the Sun. This is a most extraordinary complex, and well worth tracing out in every detail, for it shows a marvelous medley of passions. Restricting ourselves to the immediate subject, we must observe that while Saturn is strengthened by these aspects and the character is thus made more dominant, this fact only accentuates the callousness of Saturn in Leo; it in no wise mitigates it.\n\nThe case of Havelock Ellis, the calm dissector of the sex problems of his fellow-creatures, next occupies our attention. Saturn, opposed by the Sun and Moon, is trine to Mars and sextile to Jupiter. The opposition is square to Pluto, giving the ability to dispassionately face facts without flinching. It is a fortunate combination for character so far as its effective control is concerned; he is indeed one of the few men that have been able to immerse themselves in the study of such subjects without the least suspicion of taint therefrom; but it is not suggestive of any great degree of warmth from the more human points of view.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

So Virgo is found even more sympathetic to Saturn than Gemini. The heights may not be so high as the best dignities in Gemini, but there is never danger of any real trouble. Virgo being an earthy sign is more of the nature of Saturn, and the agricultural implication is also present to link them. This kinship tends greatly to stability of moral character, and to the confirmation of practical wisdom. It gives an orderly, critical and analytical mind, usually of a serious cast if Saturn is well dignified. The intellect should be capable and original.\n\nThe affliction of the Lord of Virgo would, of course, detract from these elements, and perhaps wring reason dry. So, too, would any serious damage wrought on Saturn himself. In fact, we shall find not only some of the wisest but some of the most foolish of mankind with this position; and it will be our duty to make it clear why Saturn in Virgo should act this way. One may add, before proceeding to examples, that, Virgo being the Hermit in the Tarot, the solitariness of Saturn is brought out and emphasized by this sign. Every one of our examples will be found a person of solitary habit and disposition. This must be taken as modifying and illustrating everything that may be said of them in other ways. Three great theosophists, H. P. Blavatsky, Rudolf Steiner and Colonel Olcott have all this position of Saturn, H. P. Blavatsky is enormously strong, being in exact conjunction with Mars, and very close conjunction with Mercury. These indicate the extraordinary strength of will and persistence which she possessed, so far as the mental plane was concerned.\n\nMr. Steiner&apos;s Saturn is not so unique or so dominant. He has the opposition of Sol, but luckily the square of Uranus lends illumination, and the trines of Mars and Pluto lend power. However, the main point is abundantly confirmed. The forces which concentrate and resist disintegration are supreme; the opposition of Sol only indicates that this is accomplished somewhat at the expense of the vitality.\n\nColonel Olcott&apos;s Saturn received no assistance from any quarter beyond a trine of Mars and semi-sextile of the Sun and Venus. Here, then, is a case of a moral character strong enough, but not more than enough. He made consequently an admirable Chief of Staff, but lacked great originality. He was a modern St. Paul to theosophy.\n\nRather like him in character are three British Generals, best known of any in their day; Roberts, Wolseley and Gordon. The first of these has Jupiter rising, in exact opposition, and Mercury in exact conjunction, the Moon square, and a trine to Neptune. The latter gave him the insight to foresee the Great War. The former shows that his warning would fall upon deaf ears. The whole configuration caused him to become a prominent figure in that war.\n\nGordon, on the other hand, a much less fortunate soldier, was of tremendous moral force, influencing the whole trend of English thought, even from the distance of China. His Saturn, too, is exactly opposed by Jupiter, but being part of a tight Grand Earth Trine with Mars and Neptune more than atones for this. The coordinated planets in Earth signs qualified him for the Royal Engineers. Saturn is the reaction planet of a perfect Kite pattern (each of the four planets is at 27 degrees). &ldquo;According to all biographers, Gordon was an extremely talented military leader and strategist, with a knack for pulling men together and forming them into a fearsome fighting force.&rdquo; (lmrodden)\n\nLord Wolseley, least of the three, has a very flabby Saturn. Venus is trine, and Neptune and Mercury nearly trine, and this is all the help that he gets. We have, therefore, an able soldier, whose moral force is weak, and in the end he was shelved, as might be expected with the Sun squared by Saturn.\n\nAnother soldier is seen in President Garfield, and again there is only the aid of a trine of the Moon, a sextile of Mars and a semi-sextile of Venus. There is, however, no affliction and we may take it that Saturn in a sympathetic sign like this is strong enough for all the ordinary purposes of life. It is only in serious crises that additional help is required; and doubtless Saturn&apos;s position in the twelfth (the house of treachery) was responsible for his assassination.\n\nA ruler of a very different sort was Emperor Nero, although his early promise was so bright. But though Saturn was trine to Venus, it was square to a conjunction of Mars, the Sun, and Pluto on the Ascendant&mdash;the effect seems to have been to loosen the moral sinews. Another infamous Saturn in Virgo native, Lucrezia Borgia, has Venus in opposition&mdash;her love life became a pawn to politics. Pluto exactly square Jupiter describes her powerful family.\n\nWe may now consider the case of the anarchist and bomb-thrower Vaillant, who has the conjunction of Jupiter and the opposition of Neptune, as well as the square of Uranus and Mercury. Jupiter counteracts the firmness of Saturn and Neptune attacks the weakened planet with the full force of his eccentricity. The result we know. Note, however, in particular how the disturbance takes place in the mind on its practical side: Saturn in Taurus (for instance) with similar aspects, would have furnished a totally different picture.\n\nIt will be instructive to contrast the dreamy melancholy mind and temper of Coleridge with the bright, positive, firm yet whimsical mind and temper of Lewis Carroll. The poet has Saturn in conjunction with Venus and Neptune. The will to resist is altogether eaten up, and opium naturally had no trouble in enslaving him.\n\nThe author of &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo; on the contrary had the trine of Mercury, and Saturn rides gaily in the ninth house, like that of Coleridge, but uninterfered with by any weakening forces. Yet the brighter planets helped Coleridge far more; in all that really counts he was the greater man. It is only on the plane of life, in the bonds of time and space, that he failed. &ldquo;His giant wings interfered with his walking.&rdquo;\n\nHalf way between these two stands Bulwer-Lytton. Saturn is in the third house opposed to Pluto in the ninth, and neither very strong nor very weak. There is nothing to interfere with his free action, and so the native was able to manage his affairs remarkably well, and with prudence and cunning. He never obtruded his moral strength, but it never relaxed; and this is one of the principal keys to a successful career.\n\nIn the case of George Sand there is a trine of Mars, and a sextile of Neptune, making the character vivacious, kaleidoscopic, and full of genius. There is no hindrance, but great help to the self-control and in addition there is the inestimable quality of variety.\n\nThe character of Maurice Maeterlinck now claims our attention. Here Saturn has a square from Uranus, good for mystic insight but rather tending to disturb the concentration. But Mercury is not far from conjunction, so we see the self-interested qualities reinforced by shrewdness and cleverness.\n\nWriter, poet, dramatist, novelist, essayist, painter, architect, critic, and humanitarian genius Victor Hugo has Saturn conjunct Jupiter opposing a conjunction of the Sun, Pluto, and Venus, with a semi-sextile of Uranus. This complex is difficult to disentangle; one need, however, only remark that the absence of help from Mars diminished the possibilities of his becoming the hammer; he had to take the part of the anvil. Saturn, however, is strong enough, and on the mental plane he was able to do great work, fulminating from his exile with very great effect against the tyrant who had put him there.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

The Venusian character of the house tempers his asperity, even though there is always some sinister implication in the association of Venus with Saturn, and the judicial function of Libra assures good balance to the conservative and concentrative force of the dark planet. We shall therefore expect to find that the natives are well able to take care of themselves, and exercise both tact and judgment in the management of their personal affairs. The exceptions will, as before, be due to some unusual affliction either of the planet or the ruler of the house.\n\nBoth the philosophical and religious temperament are well developed in this position. In orthodoxy we have Cardinal Gibbons with Saturn trined by Jupiter on one side and by Neptune on the other. There is no impediment to the ego, and, with all else favorable, his ambition was certain of gratification. Savonarola, though a reformer, was only so in his denunciation of corruption in Church and State. Mars and the Moon oppose and square his Saturn, so that dreams of violence haunt his dark spirit, and place obstacles continually in his path. His is a good example of a strong Saturn thwarted.\n\nTwo great heresiarchs now attract our notice: Swedenborg and Joseph Smith. The former has Mars in opposition and Pluto square to Saturn but the Sun is trine, and this latter aspect always means great stability of moral character. The affliction of Mars prevents the Saturnian wisdom from operating on the material plane; therefore with vision probably superior to that of Mohammed, he accomplished no more than the foundation of a new sect.\n\nJoseph Smith&apos;s Saturn has Uranus in conjunction, and the Moon and Mercury square, while Neptune stands semi-sextile. To him, therefore, we might look for the doctrinal founding of a sect; but it was the energy and practical genius of Brigham Young that made Mormonism a living force.\n\nAnother religious genius and one of high order was Swami Vivekananda. Here Saturn has a conjunction of the Moon, an opposition of Neptune, and Mercury and Venus are nearly trine. Although the position of Saturn in Libra gave him the philosophical religious bent, the afflictions give clear explanation of the sources of his collapse, to which the softening aspect from Venus materially contributed.\n\nDisraeli and Lord Northcliffe form a pair suitable for comparison, both showing immense ambition. The Saturn of Disraeli is in the tenth house, conjoined with Uranus and squared by Mercury in Capricorn; thus both enlightenment and a sense of reality modify the ambition and there is also a sextile of Mars, adding efficiency.\n\nLord Northcliffe appropriately has Saturn in the ninth house of publishing, but the Moon is in opposition, and the Sun square. The offhand prediction would be an inevitable failure, but the student must not forget that the evil effects of an opposition may be greatly mitigated by the interposition of another planet in trine to one and sextile to the other of the opposing forces. And here Jupiter, in his own sign, Sagittarius, is sextile to Saturn and therefore trine to the Moon, which accounts for Northcliffe&apos;s great wealth through his ability to gauge the newspaper reading public. The square of the Sun and opposition of the Moon by Saturn, operating generally as a threat against the constitution, indicate his comparatively early death.\n\nA great artist will illustrate the good tendencies of a well-aspected Saturn in Libra. The poet and scholar Petrarch&apos;s Saturn has the sextile of the Sun and Mercury and semi-sextiles of Neptune and of Jupiter. Here we see a very harmonious, beautiful attitude towards self, a mellowness in strength which made him so lovable a character. Saturn has an inconjunct aspect to the Moon, and in fact is part of an Arrow Yod pattern also involving the Sun, Mercury, and Jupiter, focused on the Moon, so that his scholarship focused on recovering the past and he is called a humanist.\n\nThe Saturn of J.M. Turner has the trine of the Moon, Uranus and Venus, which similarly soften the asperity of the ego-feeling and ripen it to artist-altruism. The opposition of Mercury, however, gave a practical tinge to Saturn&apos;s natural selfishness which showed in the frugality of the artist&apos;s life, even though it afterward appeared that his stinginess was really inspired by altruism, in order that he might bequeath to the nation the greater part of his imperishable work.\n\nIn a material way the position of Saturn in Libra is favorable for partnerships, especially with persons older or of better position than the native. It diminishes somewhat the austerity and selfishness of Saturn, moves the sympathies, and slightly favors the mystical side in religion.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

There is naturally, however, something deep, obscure and sinister in this position of the planet, and where it has a fair chance it will give such a tone to the Akankara, the name given by the philosophers of India to the &ldquo;ego-making faculty,&rdquo; or the Saturn force in the human character. While this position of Saturn tends to produce a character both masterful and subtle, the evidence of this peculiar effect is not easy to find on account of its very habit of concealing itself. In the case of Tennyson it was so covered by external graces (in particular, the influence of Venus), that it is only from private sources that we know that traces of this Scorpio selfishness ever existed.\n\nSimilar remarks apply to Lord Brougham. Here Saturn in Scorpio gives a harsh, unscrupulous purpose, which is developed in material affairs by the sextile of Jupiter; but Mercury and Venus just above the Ascendant conceal Saturn effectively, though he is the real director of the inner thought. The self-seeking of the great lawyer wore a mask of tact, wit and amiability, beneath which the corrosive acid of his purpose ate away his enemies.\n\nCompare with this the nativity of Archbishop Laud. Here Saturn has a square of the Moon, a trine of Pluto, and a wide opposition of Jupiter, who in the ninth house signifies religion, with no help beyond a semi-sextile of Mercury. Here is the typical selfish and intriguing prelate; Saturn on the cusp of the third house constantly occupying the mind with ambition and the lust of power. But Saturn&apos;s strength is not aided by fortune; the afflictions were bound to bring the native&apos;s ultimate downfall.\n\nCicero is a great example of this position; Saturn is sextile the Sun and squared by the Moon. The operation of the sign is intensified by these dispositions. As the first act of his public life, he fearlessly pursued and defeated a group of conspirators against the Roman republic. Ranked in the same category, though on the surface so different, his more lasting achievement, the &ldquo;Somnium Scipionis&rdquo;, is almost the only mystical treatise which the Latins have left to us.\n\nThat unfortunate monarch, Charles I of England, had this position. Here Saturn, in opposition to Uranus, is close to the cusp of the fourth house, for an ill end to the matter, and he receives no notable help. But we can gauge the desperate quality of the native&apos;s struggle to hold his inheritance, the secret and mendacious and fatal paths trodden by him in that attempt. With a preponderance of planets in mutable signs, one can only attribute to this opposition of Saturn and Uranus in fixed Scorpio and Taurus what is said about him, that he was &ldquo;self-righteous, stubborn, opinionated, determined and confrontational.&rdquo;\n\nAn example of over-development of the self is seen in the poet Thomas Moore. Mars and the Moon are in conjunction with Saturn to give recklessness and dissipation; Mercury in opposition to make it blind; only the sextile of Jupiter adds a touch of geniality, which made him welcome only as the companion of an hour in a tavern or a parlor.\n\nCompare particularly in this matter the case of the late J. Pierpont Morgan. Saturn is squaring Mars, Jupiter and Neptune, sextile to the Moon, while trine to Uranus. While there is plenty of self-preservation, the Moon and Uranus both bring vision. The dispositions are consequently not altogether bad, but the great wisdom was undoubtedly used for material ends.\n\nSir Humphrey Davy has Saturn in Scorpio, but Jupiter and Venus are sextile, and the Sun and Mars semi-sextile. Here is much favorable modification of Saturn, who is rising. Thus the self-force, rendered bright and tender by such aspects, is in complete harmony with the personality. Here strength is wedded with gentleness, and we can understand readily how he was able to give his life to its purpose without upsetting his contemporaries by bitterness of controversy.\n\nIn Goethe we find adroitness in the emphasis of his ego. Saturn just above the horizon is trined by the Moon, and has the illuminating square of Uranus, all of which harmonizes the personality with the instinct of self-preservation. This instinct is strong but clever, and we comprehend, if we do not altogether applaud, his sword and his diamond buckles.\n\nIn many ways, as has been seen, Saturn in Scorpio has critical tendencies; it imperils the reputation, may bring scandal or unpopularity and, badly aspected, may cause reverses or downfall. Its influence upon the health is rather perilous in early life, though, that period safely passed, it promises a long life. It is, however, a position very favorable for association with mystical or secret societies.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Saturn is slow and heavy, Sagittarius swift and transient; the sign is one of many-colored light; the planet as dull as lead. But Jupiter is Lord of Sagittarius, and, just as in the Roman mythology the heir of the elder god overthrew his father, the impulses of the active and spendthrift planet accelerate the slowness and loosen the selfishness of the greater orb when he enters his house, so that Saturn&apos;s normal quality in this position is a thrifty disposition not at all incompatible with real altruism.\n\nAn excellent example of a strongly spiritualized Saturn is given by Abraham Lincoln. Located in the ninth house, he has only passed four degrees past the Midheaven, to which Neptune is conjunct with him; Venus is trine and Mercury in Pisces is square to both Saturn and Neptune. It is easy to see the effect of these aspects upon the wisdom of the martyr-president. Sagittarius prepares Saturn to open more responsively to the illumination of Neptune and the warmth of Venus. The altruism is therefore very spontaneous and yet well restrained by great practicality. Mercury shows excellently the influences of both Saturn and Neptune, in the restricting delays and obstacles to early education and the sensitiveness of the mind, which explains the unfaltering devotion to an ideal. Altogether the figure is one of great faith fortified by far-seeing wisdom.\n\nIn the case of Emile Zola, Saturn in Sagittarius in the first house is trined by Mercury, Mars, Pluto, and the Moon in Aries and squared by Uranus in Pisces. The deep insight into human nature, which wrought itself into a philosophy of life expressed in the forty or more volumes of novels, short stories and essays, is amply accounted for by the Saturnian aspects of these four planets. That altruism, of the most courageous and uncompromising kind, was an essential part of his character was proved by his action in the Dreyfus case; that it manifested itself to the world at so late a period in his life may have been due to the fact that his Saturn was retrograding.\n\nAn example of great and shining activity of the preservation energy of Saturn is shown in the horoscope of Gladstone. Neptune and Venus excite the former by conjunction, Pluto is square, and Jupiter supports the combination by a trine. Here, then, we have a complete harmony of Jupiter and Saturn, which also steadies and strengthens against the weakening indicated by the conjunction, the softness of which merely adds grace and originality to the character.\n\nThomas Hardy&apos;s insight into human nature, which is not dissimilar to that of Zola, apparently comes from the same aspects of Saturn square Uranus and trine Pluto. But Saturn is in opposition to the Sun and has no help beyond a sextile of Neptune, which is rather a disadvantage in this regard. The nature is retiring and modest; the ambition is not aggressive; a novelist with a tenth of his talent, and more push, might have gained a far greater popular reputation.\n\nTchaikovsky, born in the same season as Zola and Hardy, has an excellent Saturn. Uranus is square, Pluto, Mercury, and Venus trine, and Neptune sextile. The wonderful comprehension with which he has expressed the mingled fire and melancholy of the Slavonic race is described by these aspects, especially the square of Uranus and the sextile of Neptune. A square from Jupiter magnifies Neptune. The relief from the domestic difficulties of his early life and the subsequent freedom which enabled him to devote himself to his work come through the strength of his Saturn; and his success, creating masterpieces in every branch of Music, is due to the same cause. The versatility is of course indicated by the aspect with Mercury in Aries.\n\nMadame Steinheil furnished perhaps the most convincing example of all these characters. Her Saturn in the Midheaven, opposing the Moon, is trined by Mercury, Neptune, Venus, the Sun and Jupiter, and Mars is in exact trine on the other side. Even Uranus and Pluto form a tight Yod focused on Saturn. Here then is a case where the whole cohort of heaven (one may say) concentrate upon Saturn to make him swift, subtle, active, even vehement. It is a marvelous example for successful self-seeking. Even the opposition of the Moon, which pulled her down from high eminence and placed her life in jeopardy, could not compass her entire defeat against such fortified power.\n\nIn its more material significance, Sagittarius being the natural sign to occupy the ninth house, Saturn&apos;s influence in that sign tends to give prominence and power through activity in the religious or legal world; under good aspects this activity should bring prosperity. Philosophy, science, voyaging or shipping may afford scope for the influence, according to the native&apos;s station in life, with corresponding results depending upon the nature of Saturn&apos;s aspects.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

His quality here, however, is rather rough and crude, and this does not tend to produce the best results, in so far as the effect upon the external world is concerned. There will be no altruistic thought to soften the egotism, and opposition will be likely to infuriate. In a word, Saturn in this sign makes the native harsh and overbearing, unless there be some very strong counteracting influence to soften its asperity.\n\nThe most dense form of the arrogant selfishness which Saturn in Capricorn may give is well illustrated by Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. In both charts, Saturn is badly afflicted and is situated in the fourth and eighth houses respectively. In his case, Saturn in Capricorn squares Venus, the planet of social relations; in her case Saturn squares the Moon, denying sympathy with or feeling for the common man, the public. Not only was this evil Saturn the moral cause of their downfall, but his house position also predicted their tragic end.\n\nWhere Louis XVI had a square of Venus to his Saturn, the great lover of women, Giacomo Casanova, has only a close sextile of Venus to his Saturn in Capricorn.\n\nEdward VII had Saturn rising in Capricorn, but with little affliction; even the semi-sextile of Mercury could save him from the stupidity of allowing such tendencies to manifest themselves, while his other planets gave him many lovable qualities which ensured his popularity. The Saturn of Sir Isaac Pitman, the inventor of phonic shorthand, has a conjunction of the Sun, a semi-sextile of Neptune and Venus, a semi-square of Uranus, and a sextile of Mars, We get in this a very good astrological map of the kind of force required for proper development of the ego, a steady and vigorous push, but executed on proper lines with tact and with intelligence.\n\nIn the nativity of Richard Wagner, the only support for Saturn in Capricorn is a sextile from the slow and deep planet Pluto. There is a great deal of brusquerie and instability, which was a serious limitation to the greatness of the man. He wasted incalculable energy in sterile and fruitless controversy, antagonizing some whose support might have been most valuable.\n\nThe general influence of Saturn in Capricorn is to give ambition, independence, power, authority or rulership to the native, according to his station in life. This may be accompanied by great selfishness and loneliness, or isolation may be characteristic of the life. It is frequently the case that this position of Saturn gives an unusual degree of melancholy to the mind.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Even when unoccupied by Saturn, his influence tends to make its natives comprehend the true significance of the ego, tempering the crude consciousness of the self with some understanding of its cosmic importance. Of course, evil aspects are able to upset even so favorable a position. We have, for example, Ludwig II of Bavaria, whose Saturn, in conjunction with Mars and Neptune, is squared by Jupiter in Taurus; this entirely unbalances the ego, loosening all the natural restraints and slackening even the cords of reason. Saturn being on the cusp of the ninth house, the attack was peculiarly severe, and we cannot be surprised that madness should have terminated the concourse of these forces.\n\nConsider however, such scholars as Sir Richard Quain, the medical lexicographer, and Picus de Mirandola. The former has Jupiter square to Saturn as in the case of the Bavarian King, but Neptune and Uranus are sextile, and Saturn is in the sixth house, where there is no menace to the mind. Moreover, the Jupiter aspect is from Scorpio, and Scorpio and Aquarius make a good, scientific combination, especially for a doctor. The Saturn of Picus de Mirandola, is in conjunction with Mercury, trine to Neptune, in opposition to Pluto, and square to the Moon. Such a combination gives deep penetrating insight to the mind, and an isolation which, coupled with the normal persistency of Saturn, promises a great philosophic scholar.\n\nIn the starry career of Cleo de Merode, we have Saturn just above the Ascendant, opposed by Uranus, with the two forming a T-Square to Pluto in the house of money; there is a wide trine from Mercury; the ego is therefore selfish enough, but clear-sighted and clever; hence a resourceful and shrewd pushfulness, adroit and subtle, landed her quite early in life at the top of the ladder of success in her ancient profession.\n\nLet us now turn to Louis XIV, one of the cleverest and most resourceful rulers that ever lived; a man as successful in aggrandizing his ego as was Queen Victoria. Here Saturn has a square of Jupiter from Scorpio, an exact trine to powerful Pluto, and an opposition of the Moon and Venus. It is a purely selfish combination, but extremely strong; for Venus and the Moon are so overpowered by Saturn that all the gracious and feminine qualities of the man are constrained to serve his selfishness as its handmaidens.\n\nA very successful type, too, was Byron, whose angular Saturn on the Midheaven is trine to Jupiter and also to Neptune. It has the restless inconjunct aspect to a conjunction of the Moon and Uranus. Venus is in conjunction&mdash;this is always a corruption to Venus, but where Saturn is so radically strong, she cannot hinder his success, although her influence is shown in the arrogance and vanity of the poet.\n\nBismarck, for contrast, has Saturn conjoined with Mars, sextile to the Sun and Uranus, and trine to Jupiter. The square of Venus confirms, rather than detracts from, this general broad, deep and persistent vigor of the ego, which was marred by no petty personal selfishness.\n\nThere are two great mystics, Anna Kingsford and William Blake, whose Saturn is in Aquarius. The former, who was by far the more practical of the two, wrote two definitely propagandist books, and did really make, in the desert of Victorianism, a small oasis of a spiritual movement. Here Saturn is in conjunction with Neptune, with both sextile to Pluto, and Jupiter is approaching a trine. The Neptune aspect gives illumination to her wisdom, although it probably lessens her material success, by depriving her to some extent of the plain common sense which is necessary to genius, if that genius is to bear fruit in its own time.\n\nBlake&apos;s Saturn is also sextile to Pluto, and in opposition to Neptune, and this not only contributed to his illumination, but probably inhibited him from caring to achieve the material success that his Sun in conjunction with Jupiter should have made easy for him. Wisdom without strength crieth in the streets, and no man regardeth her; but with a proper appreciation of the value of publicity even folly can obtain a hearing!\n\nIn the material affairs, Saturn in Aquarius, if free from serious affliction, gives power and good fortune, especially in connection with associations or with public affairs. Its influence is much more democratic than that in Capricorn, though the native may still be conservative and autocratic. There is an instinct for mysticism and occultism, and the native is usually widely known in his own station in life.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Indeed, although the centripetal and centrifugal forces are exactly opposite, it is their balance that holds the universe together.\n\nPisces is a mutable and receptive sign, and in these respects it is, in the element of water, very similar to what Saturn is in that of the earth. The expectation therefore is that Saturn will be somewhat softened of his asperity by the pleasing solvent in the waters of Pisces, even as we saw to be the case with regard to his position in Cancer. But there is no detriment to the force of Saturn here, as there is in Cancer, and its peculiarly psychic nature gives a modification of the worldly wisdom of Saturn by some touch of faerie and other-world gnosis. It adds imagination, if well dignified, especially by Neptune or Uranus, and we have only to mention such names as those of Newton, Ruskin and Edison to perceive the practical application.\n\nThe first of these has Jupiter in conjunction with Saturn, harmonizing planet and sign; Uranus is trine, giving philosophical comprehension, and Mercury square, emphasizing the scientific spirit, while the sextile of the Sun assures success. The trine of Saturn and Uranus gives the essential harmony between the magical will and the personal force of bringing it into action; here then are all the elements of extraordinary greatness.\n\nEdison has Mars in Capricorn closely sextile his Saturn, which stands near Venus which closely squares Jupiter in Gemini. This gives the practical ability to implement solutions to problems of comfort and entertainment. The great inventor&apos;s Aquarius Sun stands between Mercury and Neptune, letting his innovative spirit draw alternately upon science or inspiration.\n\nRuskin&apos;s Saturn has the wide square to Uranus, conjoined with Neptune, and the semi-sextile of the Sun. The constructive ability of Saturn, helped only by this very weak Sun, is not highly developed. Hence he failed as a painter; failed to a great extent even as a critic by the eccentricity and acerbity of some of his judgments, although the illumination and insight of his wisdom enabled him to write that fascinating prose which has been so highly esteemed by many of his contemporaries.\n\nA good illustration of the softening of the ego under this position is afforded by Czar Alexander II. There is a sextile of Jupiter to Saturn, a square of Uranus, and a trine of Mars. From these aspects we can analyze the emancipation of the serfs. Jupiter gave the benevolent thought, Uranus the imagination required to perceive a method of effecting it, and Mars the executive force needed to carry out the will, against the opposition of all the bureaucracy and aristocracy that surrounded him.\n\nContrast with this horoscope that of Robespierre! Here we find Saturn with only the hardening square of Mercury, rising just under the horizon, and thus enormously strong by position. We see utter selfishness unredeemed by any other quality; the Mercury aspect itself, ordinarily good, here means nothing more than the cold perspicacity which, harnessed to the plough of his egotism, and stimulated by a conjunction of Mars and Neptune square to the Sun, drove ruthlessly through the furrows of France, where, sowing only murder, he reaped terror and desolation.\n\nNotwithstanding the softening influence of Pisces in the psychic development of the ego and its wisdom, the position is not generally a fortunate one for the material affairs. Unless Saturn is very well aspected, it is unfavorable to the occupation, public position, reputation and popularity of the native. If he occupies a high position in life, he may suffer severely from attacks of his inferiors and be subjected to much criticism from friends and enemies alike. In an inferior position he is apt to find hostility on the part of his superiors. But here it may once again be emphasized that the material trials of the world are the distillment of the wisdom of the soul, and it is particularly to that wisdom that all the benefits of Pisces for Saturn apply.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Nor, as a rule, will he be capable of seeing that he has changed in any respect. There is nothing particularly constructive in this type of energy. A strong example of this temperament is found in Mrs. Annie Besant, Aries being the rising sign. In Pope Alexander VI, the same qualities are apparent; but here Capricorn and Saturn are rising; and, although Mars is exalted in Capricorn, and so not inharmonious with the Aries temperament, yet a Saturnian element is super-added with the most unfortunate results. Here Saturn conjoins the Sun and both are square to Mars oppose Uranus.\n\nPeople with Uranus in Aries are always so firmly convinced they are right that opposition to their wishes appears to them as something positively unjustifiable, and they are therefore entirely unscrupulous in crushing such opposition. Sometimes this masterful quality is confined to legitimate lines, as in the case of Edison. Scorpio is rising, and its Lord, Mars, which sits on the cusp of the money house, is conjunct the Moon, representing the public. As an independent newspaper boy, young Edison learned what interested the public and innovated ways to make money; he would go on to earn much money from the 1093 valuable inventions that he patented. Pluto and Neptune are strong and add to Edison&apos;s inventiveness.\n\nContrast with Edison&apos;s Uranus the case of the Earl of Strafford (Thomas Wentworth), and Cromwell, who both had Uranus in Aries. It will also be instructive to compare them with each other. Each had an iron will, an unscrupulous determination to have his own way at any cost; but Strafford has Virgo rising. He prepared a plan for dealing with Ireland called &ldquo;thorough,&rdquo; which was effectively to legalize massacre; but there is no passion in Virgo to cooperate with such violence, and Strafford was not strong enough to carry the plan out; he hung fire. Cromwell, with Aries rising, went through Ireland like a new Attila.\n\nAnna Kingsford had Uranus in Aries; with Aquarius rising it is the ruler of the chart. Uranus gets more favorable aspects than any other planet&mdash;receiving trines from the Leo Moon and Midheaven, sextiles from Jupiter and the Ascendant, and an exact biquintile from Mercury. A close conjunction from Mars strengthens the Virgo Sun. Here we find, then, a great example of the driving force of these configurations&mdash;Anna Kingsford, despite all disqualifications, disposed of an initiating force sufficient to arouse the thought of half the world. It is her work which made the growth of Theosophy and its analogous cults at all possible. She was, doubtless, the head of the battering-ram that broke in the gates of the materialistic philosophy of the Victorian Age.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson has the last degrees of Aquarius rising, but Pisces is intercepted in the Ascendant, and Uranus in the first degrees of Aries is just within it. There is no great natural harmony between Aries and Aquarius, but their presence together in the first house creates harmony. So we find Stevenson, despite the most distressing ill-health, producing masterpieces. Astrologic students of literature may attribute to Aquarius his curiously gentle, profound psychology, and to Uranus conjunct Pluto in Aries the passion for bloodthirsty incident, which may also be credited to the position of his Mars conjunct Sun in Scorpio. Saturn is also in the Ascendant, just above Uranus, and this adds the tinge of melancholy which so increases his incomparable charm.\n\nAnother example is Ludwig II of Bavaria. Here Uranus in the eleventh house is in semi-square to a conjunction of Neptune and Mars on the Midheaven. We also see a conjunction of Mercury and Venus in Virgo in the fifth house, where these two planets are the focus of a yod pattern from Mars+Neptune and Pluto. So we see a dreamy, easy, pleasure-loving temperament, which bursts out at times into maniacal enthusiasms and extravagances. The lack of harmony between Uranus and Neptune is the essential blot in the personality which ultimately manifested itself as madness.\n\nA final example is Abbas Effendi. Aquarius is rising, and Uranus in Aries is just within the second house. Uranus is sextile to Saturn in Aquarius and to the Sun with Mercury in Gemini; Uranus becomes the focus of a Talent Triangle pattern. Here we see the same gentle profundity as Stevenson&apos;s. But Neptune is rising opposed to the Moon; and, instead of the tremendous will which enabled Stevenson to rank with the greatest masters, there is but a soft and somewhat undefined personality, its Will remaining interior, not externalized, since the forces that oppress it are too strong to overcome, and also since Neptune, opposing the Moon, exercises an inhibitory influence on all continuous activity.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);
INSERT INTO Text VALUES (NULL,4,1443109011679,2,NULL,21785,'Uranus in Taurus',NULL,'# Uranus in Taurus\n\nThis position is highly favorable for Uranus, for his great energy is set to honest constructive work. One can immediately instance such empire-builders as Napoleon, Cecil Rhodes, and Wilhelm II; and, on the higher planes, we find two persons who actually invented new theogonies, which philosophy declares to be the highest creative work possible to the human intelligence. We refer to Dante Alighieri and Swedenborg, whose conceptions of Hell still hold sway over the minds of great masses of men. Such empires endure long after earthly thrones have crumbled.\n\nSwedenborg has religious Jupiter rising in Capricorn, in trine to his Uranus conjunct the feeling Moon on the cusp of the mental third house; Dante has intellectual Gemini rising, and Uranus well above the horizon in the twelfth squaring Mars and Neptune in Leo. These differentiations are, of course, at once apparent in the work which each accomplished. Wilhelm II has Cancer rising, and accordingly he has been criticized, by his own subjects, for that obstinate devotion to peace which delayed (and thus made more uncontrollable, ultimately), the outbreak of the Great War. Rhodes had Sagittarius rising, with Jupiter, its lord, just above the horizon. Swedenborg&apos;s Jupiter was exactly trine to Uranus and the Moon, emphasizing the religious bent; that of Rhodes is squared by Neptune, which would tend to remove such bias from Jupiter, leaving his force to manifest itself on those more terrestrial lines which Sagittarius implies for Jupiter. Napoleon had Libra rising, and his Uranus is in the seventh house; but Libra and Taurus are sympathetic, through the fact that Venus rules both; and Venus is sextile to Uranus, and culminating. There lies the explanation of his extraordinary sense of justice; the Code Napoleon ranks with the achievements of the greatest law givers and is the basis of the laws of several European nations.\n\nTrade unionist Tom Mann has this planet in the Ascendant, but Aries is on the cusp. The two signs are contrary in nature, so there is a lack of harmony. His Will-force is occupied entirely with Taurus in its lowest form, that of labor; the exact sextile of Neptune to Uranus lends eccentricity to the ideas involved, and Aries rising makes the temperament violent and abrupt. Uranus thus assumes its most explosive form, and the result is an extreme agitator. A superficially most dissimilar case is that of Charles I. Here Leo is rising, and Uranus is on the cusp of the tenth house, always a dangerous position for a malefic. Leo gives the good-heartedness characteristic of that unfortunate monarch, but Neptune rising made his temperament unstable; this, combined with the obstinacy of will shown by Uranus in Taurus, gave a disposition which could bring only disaster. There is a very cognate example in Mr. Asquith, whose obstinate patience kept him long at the head of a most unruly majority in the House of Commons. Here Cancer is rising, making him tactful and pliable on the surface; Uranus in Taurus, in the house of friends, which trines the Moon and Mercury, enables him to conceal beneath that apparent amiability a determination of steel (Saturn closely opposes Jupiter in the fixed signs of Taurus and Scorpio).\n\nA case of very similar persistence in a woman is furnished by Lily Langtry. In a woman&apos;s horoscope, one naturally expects to find the Venus influence of Taurus brought out fully, especially as Libra is rising; so the career is marked as singularly successful. The constructive force is able to develop itself without too great hindrance, especially as the Sun is rising, sextile to Jupiter. No doubt, this aspect determines the character of the object of her will; for example, had Saturn and the Moon been in the Ascendant, she might have become an indefatigable worker among the poor.\n\nFinally, we have a large group of writers. We may pair, for convenience, Bernard Shaw and Havelock Ellis. The Uranus of the latter being in the third house caused his mind to occupy itself with very unusual subjects; Aquarius rising gave a scientific turn to the personality; and the result is his monumental study of the Psychology of Sex.\n\nShaw, with Gemini rising, has Uranus just above the eastern horizon, at the halfway focus point between a square of Jupiter and Saturn; the unusual character of the man is thus emphasized; but Uranus conjunct the Moon makes him vacillating and even self-contradictory. Gemini rising adds to the airy lightness of the personality, and conceals the tremendous driving force of Uranus. For, beneath the mask of easy wit and paradox, Shaw has undoubtedly done more to upset conventional ideas than any other man in England since Swinburne.\n\nAmong novelists, is Guy de Maupassant. It is hardly too much to say that he created the short story in France. Here is Virgo rising, with Venus on the horizon in conjunction with Mars. This violence of passion, with Uranus conjunct Pluto in the eighth house, presaged his melancholy and appalling death; but, before this effect could take place on the physical plane, it must first produce that miraculous labor whose fruit is still so sweet in our mouths.\n\nWith this we may compare the horoscope of Oscar Wilde. Here Uranus is again too near the tenth to make for permanence. Virgo rising has its lord, Mercury, near an opposition to Uranus; a careful consideration of the difference in these dispositions will make most significant the variation of his career from that of the great French writer. But we must once more point out that Uranus in Taurus has great constructive power; Wilde&apos;s work produced a tremendous effect upon the younger generation, and its permanence in literature seems now assured.\n\nThen there is Mabel Collins, who also did much to make the success of the Theosophical movement by her interesting writings. As in the case of Lily Langtry, Libra is rising; but, Saturn being in exact conjunction with Uranus, Venus trine to them, and Neptune sextile, with Jupiter in the Ascendant, the career is less material; the direction of the will is more towards power of a subtler and more permanent sort.\n\nLastly, we have two similar poets, Coleridge and Philip Bourke Marston. The former has Sagittarius rising, which adds its element of shy suddenness to the personality; it is refined and beautiful, like a deer. Uranus in the fifth house gives that mystic tinge which is the essence of the beauty of his poetry; but, alas! when it worked down to the material plane, it made him the slave of his pleasures. The pre-Raphaelite poet, on the other hand, has Leo rising, and was generous, frank and free. Uranus in the ninth house gave him another kind of mysticism. Both men were, however, strongly determined by Uranus in Taurus. Their work is patient, steady, and constructive. Coleridge&apos;s Uranus is hampered by the exact square of Jupiter, and Marston&apos;s unfortunate blindness no doubt prevented his will from coming to full flower; but the determination, in both cases, is most evidently there.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

We shall find in this position few persons preeminent for driving force of will. Their power will be mainly that of idea; and, unless the rising sign be thoroughly harmonious, and both its lord and Uranus himself well-dignified, we may expect examples rather of failure than of success. We have, however, two great religious teachers, each distinguished for the gentleness of his doctrines and the suavity of his methods. These are Swami Vivekananda, and Dr. Rudolph Steiner.\n\nThe Hindu adept has Capricorn rising, with the Sun and Venus in the Ascendant, and these are square to Mars. Uranus is in the fifth house; this made him efficient as a teacher of occult philosophy. But there is no great harmony between Gemini and Capricorn, so that the complete temperament is not so efficient.\n\nThe German mystic, with Scorpio rising and Jupiter in the ninth, adds great scientific accomplishment to the Uranian force. Mars and Pluto, the lords of Scorpio, are conjunct and semi-sextile to Uranus; but the latter is squared by the Sun, gravely diminishing the mundane potency of the planet, which is, moreover, in the seventh house, by no means a powerful position in such a case.\n\nAnother type is Maurice Maeterlinck; here airy Libra is rising with its lord, Venus, high in the tenth house, and Mars is sextile to Uranus. Consequently, Uranus is energized and the quality of the rising sign is harmonious with that of its placement. The difference between Scorpio and Libra is that one &ldquo;hacks through&rdquo; while the other is adroit, subtle, weighing every word.\n\nIn the former category is Billy Sunday. Scorpio is rising, with Mars and Jupiter in close conjunction just above the cusp of the Ascendant, and here we see the brutal thrust of the personality, breaking through all obstacles to attain its ends. And here again the effect is upon the minds of men. But there is nothing subtly persuasive; the only weapon is the bludgeon. He literally tries to bully men into belief&mdash;or what, for the moment, passes for belief.\n\nAnother vigorous personality was Mrs. Pankhurst, with Aquarius rising. Aquarius and Gemini are friendly enough, and thus we observe that, within the narrow limitations (Mercury is afflicted by the conjunction of Saturn in the sixth, a most unfortunate house for the mental ruler), her will has produced very remarkable results.\n\nRichard Strauss has Cancer rising, and Uranus not far above the Orient. The Moon, lady of Cancer, is in the third house, in Virgo; thus the mind and the temperament are in tune; and Cancer is a sign most delicate and pleasing, receptive of harmonious impulses from without. The Sun, too, lord of Music, is with Uranus, and Venus stands the morning star above them. How beautiful a picture of the temperament of the composer of &ldquo;Electra&rdquo; and &ldquo;Salome&rdquo;!\n\nJ. M. W. Turner is another excellent example of this position. One may ask where lies the peculiar force of Gemini; but a further investigation of the horoscope will justify wisdom of her children. Capricorn is rising with Saturn in close trine to Uranus, thus harmonizing the personality, while Uranus himself is modified by the conjunction of Venus, the planet of gracious form and brilliant color. A certain ruggedness and power is added to these by the square of Mars.\n\nA far less amicable disposition is found in the nativity of Thomas Moore. Scorpio is rising, and there is the successful man, no doubt, especially as Mars is in his own house, just above the eastern skyline. But he is sorely weakened by the conjunction of the Moon and Saturn, while Uranus is squared by Jupiter. Hence, the extremely narrow limit of his art, and the monotony of his melody. Uranus, too, is in the seventh house, and it is never well for the will to conflict with the personality. Moore&apos;s ambition was never equaled by his achievement; and his best-known work is not vital or elemental.\n\nOne of the greatest chemists that ever lived was Sir Humphrey Davy. He, too, had Scorpio rising, but its lord Mars in Libra is in exact trine to Uranus, giving him that noble devotion to justice, in Nature, which made him so perfect an observer. Here, then, is a temperament of ideal balance, and the will worked freely at its gigantic and most honorable ambition. It may be objected that Mars is in his detriment, but the trine of Uranus fully compensates for this weakness. Scorpio gives the inquiring mind, and the position of Uranus in the Zodiac could not but operate freely with such assistance. With Neptune and Jupiter in conjunction in the House of Fame, the native was assured not only of success, but of recognition.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

It will tend to soften his violence but may, under favorable conditions, be found to modify and expand the force, just as some pungent perfume needs to be spread out more thinly before the olfactory nerves can perceive it. We shall, then, expect to find the power of Uranus neutralized by Cancer; and, whether this leaves a residuum potent and yet pleasant will depend far more than in other signs upon the Ascendant, and upon the dignities and aspects of the lord thereof, and upon those of Uranus himself.\n\nWe shall certainly not expect to discover many people who have revolutionized their age, who have dominated their contemporaries in any radical manner. We shall not find any great strength of will, any true masterfulness of temperament, unless the Sun is in a fixed sign. Nevertheless, Cancer is ruled by the Moon and therefore the position implies an unusual degree of psychic power, and renders the native capable of becoming truly submissive to the deep, subconscious will.\n\nIn twenty-eight degrees of Cancer is the Uranus of Byron, and here Leo has doubtless some influence. But Cancer is rising, and its lady, the Moon, is in close conjunction with Uranus. The temperament is therefore harmonious within itself, but easy-going, pleasure-loving, artistic, sensuous, eccentric, and mutable. The power of the character comes rather from Mars (in his fall) on the cusp of the Ascendant. This configuration seems admirably to describe the best and the worst of the poet. Strong-willed and self-willed he was, yet unable to persist in will; he was at once weak and violent, stormy and querulous; with all his advantages and his talents, his rank and his reputation, he died a disappointed man, having sought in vice that victory which comes only from virtue.\n\nAnother hot-tempered individual was Queen Elizabeth I, whose Uranus is in conjunction with Saturn, in the house of marriage and of public enemies, the seventh; thus being practically in opposition to her Ascendant. Here is a fatal opposition of personality and temperament. The whole substance of her will was bound up in the seventh house, and, arrogant and masterful as her personality was, she could never secure her dynasty. In spite of all the glories of her reign, its tragedy was her failure to save her house.\n\nThere are two other persons of importance who have this position of Uranus&mdash;Alfred Harmsworth (Lord Northcliffe) and Rudyard Kipling, both journalists&mdash;one in the wholesale and the other in the retail business! Kipling has Uranus on the very cusp of his Ascendant, and unquestionably there was never a more self-supporting personality. He strikes a very definite note, and rises at times to extraordinary heights. He is perhaps the only author who has really succeeded in understanding and portraying the ruling class of England. The conjunction of the Sun and Jupiter, and that of Mercury, Mars, and Venus, contribute greatly to his success. But this is a digression; the point here to be emphasized is the unique personal note struck by Uranus on the Ascendant, and its resolution in artistic form by the fact of that Ascendant being Cancer. With Harmsworth the case is different. Jupiter is rising in Sagittarius, and the Uranus in Cancer becomes of secondary importance. It merely ties him down to a method, that of working upon the people, by publicity. The suddenness and boldness of his schemes are determined by the rising sign.\n\nThe artist Sir David Wilkie is a good example of this position. Gemini is rising, and its lord, Mercury, is weakened by the opposition of Mars, so that the influence of Uranus in Cancer comes out strongly. Uranus is trine to the Sun, but the closer aspect is a square to Neptune in Libra, confirming the artistic predisposition conferred by Cancer. Therefore, he was a successful painter with a keen sense of beauty, but with nothing in him to set the world on fire.\n\nOur last example is Madame Steinheil, the French woman famous in connection with the deaths of President Félix Faure and her own husband and stepmother. In this nativity Aquarius is rising, but there are no less than five planets in Aries, all just under the Ascendant, and Saturn, the lord of the Ascendant, is trine from the tenth house, to all of them in general, and to Neptune in particular. Here, then, is the insatiable ambition, limitless and indomitable, which devoured her. Uranus in Cancer is not important, except that, being in the fifth house, it gave her the temperament of pleasure, and laid down the lines along which she worked to aggrandize her vaulting personality. Saturn in the tenth house laid his scythe to the root of her tree in the very season of its blossoming.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Apollo is called &ldquo;creator and destroyer&rdquo;; the Lingam is addressed by the Greeks as &ldquo;all-begetter, all devourer,&rdquo; and this force is now seen to be concentrated in Uranus. Unless the Sun in a man&apos;s horoscope is reasonably well-dignified, there is danger to the life of the native. The presence of Uranus in the house of the Sun is itself an affliction of the Sun on the material plane; and so the Sun must be well-dignified in other ways, or the native is likely to die before the occult power of the planet has time to manifest itself.\n\nThere is, accordingly, a notable paucity of examples of the proposition which we have put forward as to its natural action when isolated; since, from the nature of the case, such isolation is rather rare. Shelley is our one great example; and his case is, fortunately, very perfect. We see the revolutionary influence at work in Greatheart; the rebel against the fetters that bind humanity, overflowing with solar force and love which blazes on high, melting the cold passions of age and experience with his flaming jets of white-hot vapor of gold. Such works as &ldquo;Prometheus Unbound&rdquo; and &ldquo;The World&apos;s Tragedy&rdquo; are pure Uranus in Leo. Shelley was saved from premature death through illness by the conjunction of the Sun with Venus, lord of his Taurus ascendant; they are both within six degrees from Uranus in the fifth house of creative play. For the circumstances of Shelley&apos;s early death, look to the lord of the eighth house, Jupiter, contained between a conjunction of Mars and Neptune. Early as this came, he had done his work; he had sown a new seed in the fields of humanity, one of the most fruitful ever planted.\n\nAnother case of the most promising talent cut short is King Edward VI, admittedly the most accomplished scholar of his period. At an age when most boys are still struggling with the elements of Latin, he spoke fluently not only that comparatively easy language, but also Greek and Hebrew. Here again, however, the Sun is only seven degrees from the square of Uranus, and is himself squared within one degree by the Moon. Mercury, lord of the Ascendant, Virgo, is squared by Mars, again within one degree; with such aspects it was impossible for the promise of youth to be fulfilled in the achievement of age.\n\nAnother striking example of the seductive, fascinating temperament given by Uranus in Leo is Mary Queen of Scots. She stands out from all other queens, for beauty and tragedy, not because these elements were so much greater than in the others, but on account of the temperament itself, which has the faculty of inspiring the most amazing extremes of attraction and repulsion. There is never anything half-hearted about the feeling with which such people are regarded. With Shelley, half the world made him Apollo incarnate; the rest thought, and even wrote, that he was, in sober truth, not a man at all, but a devil sent specially from hell to plague humanity. So with Mary Queen of Scots. She had Taurus rising, and Venus in square to Uranus and semi-square to the Moon. The Sun is trine to Uranus; but, the Sun being in the eighth house, a violent death was presaged as soon as the directions permitted; which duly came to pass. Rather similar is the personality of Cleo de Merode, whose fascination may be held to match that of the unhappy Stuart queen, having the same serpentine quality. Here Pisces is rising; the life is made secure by the trine of Mars to the Moon; and there are no afflictions to injure the native.\n\nAnother example of fascination is Winston Churchill, perhaps the most attractive personality in English politics. At an age when most men, even if they started with his advantages of birth and wealth, are just taking their seats for the first time in Parliament, he was a Cabinet Minister, holding the most responsible portfolios. The Ascendant is right on the cusp between Virgo and Libra, and Mars and Jupiter are in the Ascendant; the Sun is sextile to Saturn, so that the life is well-protected. However, Mercury, ruler of the career tenth house, squares Uranus, and a sudden fall from power, such as took place in 1915, was naturally to be expected.\n\nSometimes the temperament of Uranus in Leo confers unique powers in some obscure direction. One may instance &ldquo;Datas, The Memory Man&rdquo; (W.J.M. Bottle) with Cancer rising, and the Moon in opposition to Uranus, limiting the mental powers to his peculiar faculty of remembering dates. Somewhat like him, is Houdini, with unequalled dexterity in one trivial, but most unusual accomplishment, that of being able to extricate himself from bars or fetters. The square and opposition of Mars and Saturn to Uranus, ruler of Aquarius the Ascendant, indicate the special line in which the temperament is displayed.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Sometimes, the influence, as in the case of Cancer, becomes harmonized and fixed; but this will only be in special cases. For the most part, one is likely to find eccentricity and mental instability, and it is not often that any great driving force is developed.\n\nNevertheless, we are at once confronted with the case of Balzac, presumably one of the greatest novelists that ever lived. But here Leo is rising, and Uranus, though just within the second house, has no planet between him and the horizon. The Sun, lord of the Ascendant, is in conjunction with Jupiter in the tenth house. There is no lack of harmony between the personality and the temperament, except for the mercurial touch given by Virgo, which made the master personally very eccentric in manner, and somewhat unintelligible in his actions, at least to the majority of his contemporaries. But this could also be due to the Moon in Sagittarius being in square aspect to Uranus.\n\nBrigham Young has Uranus rising in Virgo, just within the second house, in exact sextile to Mars which is within four degrees of the conjunction of Jupiter. Mercury, the lord of Virgo, is in close conjunction with the Sun. This combination gives that tremendous energy and ability which he had, and which the mere position of Uranus would have denied him.\n\nThe Scottish satirical writer, essayist, historian and mathematics teacher Thomas Carlyle shows the decidedly mental orientation of Uranus in Virgo. In his case Uranus is strong as a result of squaring an opposition between Saturn in Gemini and the Sun in Sagittarius. The rising sign is Cancer, ruled by the Moon which trines Jupiter but squares Venus, both of which aspects describe his supportive but unhappy marriage to fellow writer and muse Jane Welsh. Carlyle&apos;s combination of a religious temperament with loss of faith in traditional Christianity made his work appealing to many Victorians who were grappling with scientific and political changes that threatened the traditional social order. We can see the influence of Uranus on the erratic, original style of his first major work Sartor Resartus (1832), which described the philosophical voyage of a free mind, anticipating both existentialism and transcendentalism. Carlyle had little sympathy for weakness&mdash;but despite that common attitude, Nietzsche regarded him as a thinker who failed to free himself from the very petty-mindedness that he professed to condemn.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Its own nature, too, is the balance; and when that balance is upset by casting such a flaming sword as Uranus into the scale, we may expect very astonishing results. Where Venus is afflicted, and Saturn strong, we shall find that the influence is often exceedingly dangerous; but good dispositions and dignities of Venus, and a harmonious rising sign and happy aspects to Uranus, himself, may bring about the development of the most useful forces. The freedom of Libra, an airy sign, will give play to the impulses of Uranus; in fact, one might almost say that he is never more himself than when he is in this sign.\n\nTaking first some rather unfortunate examples, let us consider the nativity of Joseph Smith. Note, however, that it only appears unfortunate to us in so far as we may happen not to be Mormons; we must be tolerant with those expressions of genius with which we are not in sympathy. It is, however, quite permissible for the astrologer to give planetary reasons for thinking this prophet a mistaken one. At his birth Cancer was rising, a very suitable sign for the reception of inspired knowledge; unhappily, the Moon, close to Mercury, is in exact opposition to the cusp of the Ascendant; moreover, she is in her detriment, and square to Uranus, which is conjoined with Saturn. Libra itself is not very harmonious with Cancer, and though there is much power developed, such power is bound to work in a disordered manner.\n\nThere is much tragedy in the horoscope of James II of England. Here Uranus is in the third house, with a sextile of the Moon, and a semi-sextile of the Sun, but squared by Jupiter. The Sun is lord of the Ascendant, Leo, but he is in Scorpio; and Mars is square Pluto and rising in his own decanate of Leo, the third, which represents unsuccessful struggle. Uranus, too, is in the third house, so that the mentality is eccentric. The whole outlook is gloomy in the extreme, leading one to expect an increasing tension, due to tactlessness and ill-temper, qualities which indeed cost him his throne. Contrast these positions with those of Louis XIV, &ldquo;le grand monarque.&rdquo; Here Scorpio is rising, its lord, Mars, sextile to Uranus. Instantly we see a harmony of temperament of the ambitious type; not very amiable, perhaps, but singularly strong and without inhibitions.\n\nThe severe quality of the vision of Dürer is determined by the conjunction made by Saturn with his Sun, lord of Leo, the Ascendant. Uranus is trine a conjunction of Venus and the Moon and is in the third house, making possible such pictures as the &ldquo;Astrologer&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Four Witches.&rdquo; There is a strong friendship between Leo and Libra, and the temperament is a symphony of these signs and planets.\n\nA more Venusian type of artist is Sir Joshua Reynolds. Here Virgo is rising, but in twenty-eight degrees, so that Libra occupies almost the whole of the Ascendant. Uranus is just within the second house, but there is nothing rising above him. It is, therefore, evident that his influence is quite free from admixture. A sextile of Jupiter and Saturn to Uranus lends him exceptional force, and it is to be noted that the Sun, Venus, and Mercury are all in the tenth house, and thus rule the entire figure. It may be remarked here that when there is any dispute, so to say, among the other planets, the tenth house assumes primary importance.\n\nIn literature we have, in Bulwer-Lytton, a figure analogous to that of Reynolds in painting. Here Cancer is rising, causing him to prefer antiquity to modern times, to write historical novels rather than modern, and, even when he wrote of modern times, as in &ldquo;A Strange Story,&rdquo; to introduce the ideas of the past and make them more prominent than those of the present. The Moon is on the cusp of the Ascendant, or he might have gone even farther than he did in this direction; as it was, his personality was diffuse; his tendency was to play first at magic, next at politics, then at literature. Were Cancer more appropriate to Libra, the result would have been happier; but the truth is that nothing goes well without a dash of fire somewhere in its composition. In any case this dispersion of interests is quite characteristic of Libra.\n\nThe influence of Uranus in this sign, at its best, emphasizing its most judicial quality, is seen in Sir William Hamilton, one of the greatest mathematicians that Britain has produced. Here Gemini is rising, and Mercury is in his own house, Virgo, in conjunction with Venus. This gives the mental development full play; otherwise, Uranus in the fifth house might have caused trouble. The perfect harmony of the two airy signs, and the good dignity of Mercury, allow full play to the better side of Uranus. Hence we find the metaphysician probing deeply into the most recondite mysteries of existence, and displaying the most even judgment as well as the subtlest power of analysis.\n\nIn the case of Petrarch we find the emphasis is to be laid upon the fact that Venus rules Libra. Leo is rising, giving him a large and warm heart; especially as the Sun, its ruler, is close under the cusp of the Ascendant, while Mercury, exactly on it, adds keen intellect to the personality. Venus is trine to Uranus, and lends tenderness and beauty to his fierce and passionate rays. Is further explanation needed of the circumstances that he challenges even Dante as the Poet of Love? In the horoscope of Erasmus, Uranus is in nine degrees of Libra, just above the cusp of the Ascendant, while Venus is rising just below it. But Uranus is opposed by Saturn, making the temperament cold. Mercury, too, is ascending, and the Sun is in conjunction with the Moon and Neptune in Scorpio, which diminish his glow. Here, then, is the great scholar as opposed to the great lover.\n\nA very incarnation of passion is to be found in George Sand, with 26 degrees of Aquarius rising, and Saturn sextile to Neptune. The temperament is harmonious enough, and the intellectual side of the woman is clearly indicated by the points given above, but Uranus in the seventh house, squared by the Sun from the fifth house, describes her varied affairs with men.\n\nIn the nativity of Victor Hugo, Scorpio was rising with Mars in Aquarius not specially strong, high, or well-aspected. Aquarius is friendly to Libra, however, and, as Mars is within five degrees of the trine of Uranus, the personality and temperament go well enough together. One may easily understand that this combination gave the extraordinary power for work which the great poet and novelist possessed. Dumas has Leo rising, with the Sun just above the horizon, sextile to Uranus. Here again is a splendid harmony, and its dominant note is the rich youthful glow always conferred by Leo, unless the Sun is most sorely afflicted, or Saturn present in the sign.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

The excellence of this position will depend upon the aspects to Uranus in a greater degree than is the case in other signs.\n\nThere is naturally a strong affinity between Uranus and Scorpio. With some respects, the spirit of scientific investigation, which is an important element of Scorpio, will be brought out very strongly; with others, the treacherous, subtle-witted quality of that mysterious sign; and, in a third group, we may find its sensuality and passion most deeply marked.\n\nTo begin with men of science and philosophy, we have three emancipating intelligences of the highest order: Copernicus, Newton, and Immanuel Kant. The first of these great men has Uranus in Scorpio favored by a trine to the Sun, a sextile to his Virgo Ascendant, and semi-sextiles to a conjunction of Jupiter with the Moon. The coolly analytical mentality of Virgo rising combined with the dogged investigation that characterizes Scorpio to produce the Copernican revolution in our understanding of the solar system. Sir Isaac Newton had Libra rising, giving the balanced judgment so requisite in scientific investigation. Uranus himself is within the Ascendant, and is trined by Jupiter, who is only six degrees from conjunction with Saturn. The horoscope well describes the large aspects taken by Newton&apos;s investigation. Immanuel Kant was born with Aquarius rising, the sign ruled by Uranus and noted for eclectic scientific investigation; his mind was driven into higher realms by an exact opposition from Uranus in Scorpio to the Sun in Taurus and a square from Moon in Aries to Saturn in Capricorn.\n\nThe revolutionary phase of Uranus is found in the nativity of politician and prime minister William Gladstone. He has Capricorn rising, and its ruler Saturn is conjoined with Neptune within two degrees in the eleventh house, and with Venus within nine degrees. It is easy to see that the interest must be mainly human and political, for Jupiter trines this conjunction, and is in Aries, near the cusp of the third house. The temperament is powerful because Uranus is exactly on the Midheaven, and trine Pluto. In fact, his career was tumultuous, and he sometimes suddenly reversed his policy in an arbitrary, and, as some thought, an unwarrantable manner.\n\nWe might pair Charles Dickens and Alfred Tennyson. The former has Virgo rising with Uranus sextile the chart ruler Mercury. Mars is squared by Saturn, making the temperament stronger than the personality. Hence, the man&apos;s work was more important than he himself.\n\nThe poet Tennyson, with Gemini rising, and its lord, Mercury, suffering severely from the square of Jupiter, was of a coldly intellectual, almost priggish type. Saturn is emphasized in the chart by being at the focus of a Yod from Venus and Jupiter. Uranus is exactly conjunct with Mars. But Venus is rising, sextile to Jupiter, which is in the eleventh house, and so it is easy to understand that these influences counted more than the significators of either the personality or the temperament. The high honors paid Tennyson were due more to his adroitness in pleasing his sovereign than to any other quality inherent in himself or even the excellence of his poetry.\n\nAnother Victorian example is Sir Isaac Pitman, with Libra rising; Venus is favored by a trine from Jupiter and, together with Neptune, is on the cusp of the third house, within which is Mercury. The inventive genius, therefore, turns naturally to seeking ease in matters connected with writing; in other words, to the construction of the system of shorthand which is associated with his name.\n\nBefore we proceed to the domain of art, let us look for a moment at the nativity of Caesar Borgia. Virgo is rising, with Pluto on the cusp of the Ascendant, giving a cold, shrewd personality. Uranus in Scorpio in the second house of bodily input and money has only a wide square from Mars and Saturn in conjunction in Leo. From such a configuration we can picture to ourselves the oily, violent, sensual, and perfidious qualities of the man, while the Sun rising, trine to Jupiter and sextile to Mars and Saturn, assures ambition, and success in attaining its ends.\n\nWagner has Gemini rising, which accounts for the literary quality in his work; the ruler Mercury is at the focus of squares from an opposition of Mars and Jupiter; which explains the violent and brilliant qualities of his nature and his music; Scorpionic Uranus is opposed by Venus, and the whole figure represents strife and turmoil. Venus close above the eastern horizon, in her own sign, in conjunction with the Sun, trine to Mars and sextile to Jupiter is, on the whole, the most important planet in the horoscope. Her aspects provide the channel for constructive expression and give the intense humanity, the marked dramatic and artistic feeling, especially for pictorial effect (for Wagner&apos;s music has always a visual value); and these assure success.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Only the suddenness of its action in any way resembles the typical Uranus force; but the sign itself, if its lord, Jupiter, be happily aspected, may have much power to overcome that which seems hard and cold in the planet. Cold, for the cruelty of Uranus is calculated and deliberate, for the achievement of spiritual good to the native, while that of Mars is the hot cruelty of far more human passion. But Sagittarius never fails to give liveliness to the temperament; it is as Celtic on the Ascendant as Leo or Pisces; more so, in fact, than the latter; therefore, we here find in the planet what one might whimsically call a &ldquo;reformed&rdquo; Uranus; etherealized and sublimated. But, of course, bad aspects and an inharmonious Ascendant will weaken and corrupt these qualities.\n\nFor example, the horoscope of Queen Victoria shows arrogance and petulance; impatience of contradiction. Gemini is rising, the opposition sign of Sagittarius, and Neptune in the eighth house, within five degrees of Uranus in the seventh house. Saturn squares both; but, fortunately, Venus is trine, otherwise her temperament would have been impossible. Mercury, ruler of the Ascendant, is in the twelfth house, and not particularly strong; it is very evident that the temperament plays a much larger part than the personality.\n\nGeorge Eliot has Scorpio in the Ascendant, and the Sun, Venus, Mercury, Uranus, and Neptune all in the east, not far below the horizon. Uranus in conjunction with Neptune is squared by Saturn. Mars is in Leo, trine to the Sun and Venus, but opposed by Jupiter and the Moon. The result is naturally a highly confused problem, from which it is difficult to resolve one separate, true resultant. A stormy life, and a mixed career of joy, sorrow, failure, and triumph are the visible effects of this complicated chain of causes.\n\nConsider master-mind Herbert Spencer&apos;s chart. Uranus is on the exact cusp of the Ascendant, twenty-eight degrees of Sagittarius, with Neptune in close conjunction, again a tremendous aspect. Hence the epoch-making character of his philosophy. The man himself was retiring (Jupiter, the lord of the Ascendant being in Pisces softened by the square of Venus), but there is no conflict of any kind indicated between the temperament and the personality. He was, therefore, free to work out the splendid promise of his remarkable horoscope.\n\nBismarck has the Sun, lord of his Ascendant Leo, squared by the Moon and in trine to Uranus, who is himself trine to the Ascendant. Here is, again, an excellent harmony, save that the Moon in Capricorn gives some brusquerie. On the whole, it is a disposition certain to afford the best results, from the standpoint of a career.\n\nA self-actualized figure from the Renaissance is Cornelius Agrippa. Virgo is rising, and Mercury, its lord, is not especially strong in the second house. Uranus gets strength from being at the focus of squares from the Sun opposing the Moon, and within five degrees of a conjunction with Jupiter and nine degrees of the opposition of Mars. Here we find indicated scholarship and deep thought, without any greater manifestation than some books, more curious than revolutionary, and the acquisition of a great, if not very well-deserved, reputation as a magician.\n\nAn interesting example of temperament stronger than personality is seen in Nell Gwyn, with Capricorn rising and its lord Saturn afflicted by opposition to Uranus. But Uranus is exactly conjoined with Neptune on the cusp of the eleventh house, giving the temperament an extraordinary force to work through favoritism. As the Lord of the Ascendant, Saturn, is trine to the Sun, she had also the force of character to make use of her power mainly for good. Courtesan though she was, she was probably the best influence in the life of Charles II and with Moon trine Mars and Jupiter a consistent friend to the common people.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

The power evoked is so great that no afflictions to the personality appear to daunt it, unless they are extraordinarily evil. The Magical Will of the Man, his Mission in the World, is everything to him.\n\nWe have, to begin with, Charles Baudelaire, who despite all persecutions, revolutionized French thought, and, by inspiring Swinburne as his spiritual first-born son, revolutionized English thought as well. We have Louis Pasteur, who revolutionized surgery in the teeth of the deadliest opposition; Thomas Huxley, who battled for science against orthodox religion, the most Homeric and spectacular combat of the Victorian period; Alfred Russell Wallace, one of his principal colleagues in the fight; Kruger, who broke the power of the British Empire, and &ldquo;staggered humanity&rdquo; by the dour fight that his handful of burghers put up against overwhelming hosts; Grant, who crushed Lee; Sir Richard Burton, the most desperate antagonist in private and in public life that England ever bore; and Tolstoi, who went out into the snow of a Russian winter to die in a wayside railway station so bitter, even in extreme old age, with the hand of death upon his shoulder, was his hatred of &ldquo;home&rdquo; and &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; and the normal life of man.\n\nThen we have Rosa Bonheur, whose life was one long battle against her own femininity; and, finally, George III (ruled 1760-1820), who broke, with dogged courage and endurance, the power of Napoleon.

It has been generally claimed that Uranus has a very special affinity with the sign Aquarius, and the sign is so harmonious with the planet that the native who possesses an easy-going personality will probably be little more than commonplace. Some special excitement of adversity, which tries the soul, is necessary to make the possibilities of the sign operative to the full extent; and to produce a really great emancipator.\n\nThus, in the cases of the Emperor Maximilian, and of Lords Roberts and Wolseley, we find no marked revolutionary impulse. Roberts has Pisces rising, with Jupiter just under the cusp, in opposition to Saturn and Mercury. Uranus is &ldquo;in prison,&rdquo; just within the twelfth house, with little help anywhere. There is, therefore, nothing sufficient to arouse those deeper and stronger spiritual forces to which we have learned to look for the revolutionary ideas which sway mankind.\n\nWolseley has Aquarius rising, with Saturn in Virgo not particularly strong. Uranus is near the cusp of the Ascendant, giving him the peculiar personality which, harmonizing so well with the temperament, brought him so much honor; for Uranus was close to the sextile of Jupiter. Once again, however, there is no deeper force at work; the career was conventional.\n\nThe unhappy Emperor Maximilian, who only lasted three years before he was executed, is an example of feebleness and lack of unity. The Sun and Mercury are rising in Cancer, and Jupiter is in the Midheaven; but the Moon is in the fifth house, in opposition to Mars, both squaring Neptune near the cusp of the eighth house&mdash;not the best pattern for good judgment. Uranus, too, receives no help. This is a fine illustration of how mere good fortune, unaided by personal strength, may fail to keep a man out of difficulties.\n\nThere are two humorists with this position, Du Maurier and Lewis Carroll. The former has Uranus on the cusp of the Ascendant, with the closest aspect being a 135 degree sesquiquadrate to Saturn; the Moon is conjunct Neptune and in sextile to Mercury. The latter, on the other hand, has Sagittarius rising, and Jupiter is also in Aquarius near the cusp of the third house. He has the benefit of a semi-sextile of Mars to Neptune, while Venus and Mars rising in conjunction lend passion and power to the personality. The Sun, too, is only eight degrees from Uranus, where the Uranus is similar to that of Du Maurier in being exactly quincunx (150 degrees) to Saturn in Virgo. He was a shy logician with a bad stammer, but most inventive of games and stories. It is a fortunate figure, on the whole; but, at the same time, nothing revolutionary is to be found in it.\n\nPresident Garfield has Virgo rising, with Mercury not very strong but in the third house. Jupiter is in conjunction with Uranus, which is trine Venus, square Mars, and sextile Pluto; Saturn has just risen. There is evidence here of a clever, even nature, likely to move harmoniously enough; but without that quality which overturns faiths and empires.\n\nGeneral Gordon is a stronger type. Aries is rising, with Mars sextile to Jupiter. Uranus is only ten degrees from the Sun, well above the eastern horizon. One can understand the impetuous, romantic, adventurous disposition; there are also indications of great emancipatory ideas. But there is hardly sufficient force to carry them out, as Uranus is hampered by his position in the twelfth house.\n\nCompare with these the nativity of Joan of Arc. Leo is rising, and the Sun, its lord, is sextile to the Moon; Mars is conjunct Uranus and square to Jupiter. Here is an all-conquering personality; Uranus giving the revolutionary idea, which is fired with religious zeal for the freeing of the people of her country.\n\nConsider a true empire builder, Franz Josef of Austria, who, from an ill-assorted conglomeration of races who detested each other, developed a nation which surprised the world by its unexpected internal strength in the shock of the greatest war in history. Libra is rising, giving the even judgment and sound balance necessary for such work, and Venus, in her beloved sign, Cancer, and in the tenth house, has the semi-sextile of a conjunction of the Sun, the Moon and Saturn, ensuring the affectionate devotion of all his subjects of whatever race. She is opposed by Neptune in the fourth house, which led to the domestic tragedies in his life, but failed to injure his popularity. Uranus trine to the Ascendant has the sextile of Pluto and Uranus is exactly quincunx to Mercury. To this planet, so strong in Aquarius, we must look for the revolutionary awakening of his mind which led him from a beginning of repressive absolutism to become the most sincere constitutional monarch of Europe, devoted to the best interests of all his people.\n\nA very different type of emancipator is Goethe, with Scorpio rising and Mars exalted in Capricorn, trine to Mercury and the Sun. Uranus has the square of Saturn, which is on the cusp of the Ascendant. It is a most harmonious picture, and a great one; for with such a sign rising, and such large planets involved, there must always be big things on the carpet. With this, compare Rossetti, a similar mind, but less original and far less cosmic. Taurus is rising; the ruler, Venus, is trine to Jupiter and sextile to Mercury and the Moon, to which Uranus is sextile. All this is quite as harmonious as Goethe&apos;s figure, but not nearly so big. The forces involved are more conventional and so commonplace.\n\nAnother great mind was that of Mme. Blavatsky, with Cancer rising and the Moon trine to the conjunction of Jupiter and Uranus, the latter being opposed by the Sun. The Sun is rising (near the cusp of the second house) promising success; but the other combination gives the real force of the character, the receptiveness, the religious enthusiasm, and the occult impulse all working together.\n\nHer chief of staff. Colonel Olcott, has a similar temperament. Libra is rising, and Venus is conjoined with the Sun; and the square of Mars to both contributes magnetism. Uranus is in opposition to the Sun. Naturally, such a figure promises the sympathetic service which his work manifested. The trine of Mars to Saturn in Virgo gives further efficiency, and he did his work right well.\n\nThe great sage and mystic of antiquity, Proclus, the neo- Platonist, has Uranus in conjunction with the Sun and Venus; Saturn and Jupiter are square to them. Aries is rising, Mars, its lord, being In Capricorn in his exaltation.

Here Cancer is rising with the Moon, its lady, just above the Ascendant, semi-sextile to Neptune and trine to Uranus, but in opposition to Venus, which is exactly sextile to Uranus. It should be remembered that the effect of the opposition of two planets is very much mitigated by the presence of a third, trine to one and sextile to the other. The personality is here, therefore, extremely well-suited to the temperament. The general influence, is, of course, watery, and, Uranus being in the ninth house, it is only natural that religion&mdash;and particularly that extremely personal and true religion which takes the form of direct vision&mdash;should be the key-note of the poet&apos;s career. It is interesting to note that Swinburne, who discovered Blake and introduced him to his own blind countrymen, has the same position of Uranus. Cancer is again rising, and Uranus is in the ninth house.\n\nWe may now consider two writers, singularly sympathetic to each other, Alphonse Daudet and Thomas Hardy. Romantic poet, playwright, and novelist Daudet has Pisces rising, with ruler Neptune exactly trine the Moon and square the co-ruler Jupiter, which itself is in semi-sextile to the Moon. Mercury in Aries is conjunct Venus in Taurus on the cusp of the second money house, in which house we also find Sun conjunct Mars in Taurus. Uranus on the Ascendant, on the other hand, has a square to Saturn on the Midheaven, which is one of the better aspects of these planets. The temperament is consequently very powerful and expresses itself artistically in a popular, romantic form. Novelist and poet Thomas Hardy, born three weeks later, has Cancer or Leo on the Ascendant with the Cancer Moon rising in the twelfth house and trine Jupiter. As with Daudet, Uranus has the square of Saturn; this aspect will here be taken to indicate the deep philosophical insight which permeates the realism in the works of both authors. Mercury in the eleventh house is bracketed between Venus and Mars, enabling Hardy to create passionate, sensuous brooding characters.\n\nWe shall now proceed to a consideration of the nativities of a pair of very clever and successful politicians, one born to ascend a throne and the other to own a screw factory; Edward VII and Joseph Chamberlain.\n\nThe late king of England has 28 degrees of Sagittarius rising, with Jupiter above the Ascendant and sextile to Venus and trine to Pluto. Uranus squares Jupiter and the Ascendant, but has a trine of the Sun, all of which make for success. The subtlety and astuteness with which Edward engineered the Triple Entente and isolated Germany will long be remembered in history.\n\nIn the horoscope of Joseph Chamberlain, on the other hand, while we find indications of statesmanship we note that he changed his politics frequently, doubtless due to Uranus in the tenth, but did it so successfully, that, in spite of the distrust with which he was regarded by the more intellectual classes of his countrymen, he always managed to be on the side of the majority. Cancer is rising, with the Sun on the cusp of the second house, approaching a conjunction of Jupiter; Mercury is trine to Uranus and is exactly on the cusp of the Ascendant. From the whole figure, we see an extraordinary degree of concentration and political skill.\n\nOur next pair, Jay Gould and the late J. Pierpont Morgan, should prove exceedingly instructive. Here the influence flows through a purely financial channel. Gould has Gemini rising with Mercury just below the cusp of the Ascendant, very strong in his own house, and with a trine from Moon conjunct Saturn. This is a very cold combination. There is no warmth from any source; the Gemini Sun himself is imprisoned in the twelfth house, and forms a square with Uranus. It is the very picture of a greedy, calculating, cold-blooded financier. Venus and Jupiter being in the second house turn the affections toward money, and assure its gain. The affliction of the Sun by Uranus in the tenth house shows that the financier could not escape the reprobation of his fellow men.\n\nMorgan has late Aquarius rising with Uranus in the Ascendant. Uranus is in trine to Saturn and opposed by the Moon, both of which closely sextile each other. The Sun, in close conjunction with Mercury, is exalted in Aries and is in the money house together with Venus conjunct Pluto on the cusp. Aquarius is more humanitarian than Gemini, but so far, the charts are not too different; but then we see that Morgan has Moon in Virgo and that there is a conjunction of Mars and Jupiter in Leo in the sixth house of service opposing spiritual Neptune. The personality of this powerful plutocrat is far finer and nobler than that of our last example, not nearly so concentrated upon pure gain and in no way inhibited from undertaking constructive work.\n\nThe last of our group is the French lawyer and revolutionary politician Maximilien Robespierre, who presided over the Reign of Terror. Here revolutionary Aquarius is rising; Saturn just under the cusp of the Ascendant and Uranus below him are both in Pisces, which sign is intercepted in the first house. Saturn has the semi-sextile of Venus and the square of Mercury, which indicates a successful and plausible lawyer with a sense of reality, but no load of scruple sufficient to hinder his march toward power. Uranus squared by Jupiter conjunct Pluto receives only the doubtful assistance of a semi-sextile of the Moon; and, though Jupiter is in the tenth, in his own sign, Sagittarius, trined by Mars, this cannot offset so powerful an affliction as that of Uranus, although it added executive force to the ambition. Mars is conjunct Neptune, a planet which dissolves structures, in the sixth house of service, showing where he directed his energy. His personal frugality, which made him a popular politician, can be attributed both to Saturn on the Ascendant and to a powerful Pluto in the tenth house which trines both the Moon and Mars, and which conjoins Jupiter and squares Uranus. But these aspects also made him a harsh, overbearing, ambitious, unscrupulous man, the only relief to which appears in the rising Venus, which is approaching a conjunction with Uranus; and this curiously reflects the contradictory strain of gentleness in his private home life. So, again, as in all the cases that we have been considering, we find the clearest possible witness of history through the truth of Astrology.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

His power lies more in revolution than in evolution, in the destruction of the wrong and the upheaval of the conservative. The position is spiritually radical and inclines the spiritual energies to be more dominantly mental and energetic than deep, emotional and cosmic. This is well illustrated by the religious diversity, as well as the theological skepticism, among the men and women of the Neptune in Aries generation. No two of them seem to hold the same ideas on any higher matters or on political or social matters.

He has pursued the very Taurian disciplines of paleontology and geology; his groundbreaking Catholic theology tries to reconcile God with the physical fact of evolution. Popular writer Edgar Rice Burroughs has Neptune as the focus of a favorable Kite pattern involving Venus, Jupiter, and Mars. Gifted with a prolific imagination, his novels are full of derring-do with manly men and beautiful maidens; his most famous character, Tarzan of the Apes, expresses the Neptunian yearning for a simpler life away from civilization. This retreat is found in the highest extreme in the simple life of Indian holy man Ramana Maharshi, who had Neptune conjunct Chiron and Mars in Taurus, trine the Sun and Uranus in a Grand Earth Trine, sextile Jupiter and semi-sextile Saturn.

French leader Charles De Gaulle has many favorable aspects to his Gemini Neptune conjunct Pluto&mdash;trines to Mars and Jupiter, and sextiles to the Moon and Chiron. In the case of General and President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Neptune conjunct Pluto is the focus of a favorable Kite pattern involving Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter. Horror fantasy novelist H.P.

He has Neptune trine to Jupiter; hence the mystical tinge in his religious thought. Goethe knew astrology, discussing at the start of his autobiography the propitious nature of his own horoscope.

Indeed, the rank and file of the leaders of the French Revolution were men with Neptune in Leo even as were the soldiers of our own Revolution, while the formation of the English Revolution was also due to men with Neptune in Leo.

Thus Alexander von Humboldt and Humphrey Davy, owe much of their keen, rational perception to this position, while J. M. W. Turner, Coleridge and Beethoven are exemplifications of its power in the arts.

Even Michelangelo, majestic figure that he was, was no angel; he possessed strong material passions, a proud, almost arrogant will, and a fierce temper.

The main theme observed in famous charts having Neptune in Scorpio is one of power.\n\nFamous charts with a strong Scorpio Neptune are few&mdash;one such is Disraeli, in whose chart Neptune is rising and made positive by conjunctions of Jupiter and Venus, although Neptune squares his Leo Moon. Successful as an author of romances, he earned Queen Victoria&apos;s trust as Prime Minister. Another strong Neptune is found in romantic poet John Keats, with a conjunction to his Scorpio Sun and a sextile to Uranus&mdash;the Scorpio influence is seen in that he was a medical student. Similarly, Sainte-Beuve started as a medical student&mdash;his Scorpio Neptune conjoins Jupiter and Venus and sextiles the Moon. He wrote a partly autobiographical novel Volupté; he had befriended Victor Hugo, but then had an affair with Hugo&apos;s wife. He was noted for his temper and for his acute perception of what was vital and significant in the subjects of his biographies and histories. Italian civil servant Machiavelli had Neptune conjunct his Scorpio Midheaven, trine to Mars, sextile to Pluto, but afflicted by a Saturn opposition and a square from the Moon.

The comprehensive thoroughness, the painstaking exactness, the patient depth to the will is almost Herculean in its power. Such minds cannot see, beyond the matter, the realm of substance which, in itself, they see so thoroughly. They can picture nothing which the physical eye has not beheld and the material hand has not touched. Their souls usually lack the mystic sense. Intuition is, to most of them, impossible, and inspiration is a thing beyond their comprehension. God is more commonly in this vernacular an &ldquo;essence&rdquo; of utterly impersonal power, and man the mere evolution of a tadpole. Such is the basic impulse of this type of man, which, unless modified by some dominant aspects of Jupiter and the Sun, comes out in a vision of astounding limitations. When beneficially aspected, this position may be considerably improved, particularly by aspects from Jupiter.\n\nMicrobiologist Louis Pasteur had Neptune square to Chiron, trine to Saturn, and conjunct a stellium of the Sun, Mercury, Venus, and Uranus.

This chart is also favored by a Jupiter-Saturn conjunction that trines Mercury and sextiles Venus. The French poet and avant-garde art critic Baudelaire, whose name has become a byword for literary and artistic decadence, had Neptune afflicted by a conjunction to Uranus and squares to Chiron, Mars, Pluto, Venus, Mercury, and Jupiter. He was a fastidious worker who alternated between sessions of diligence and idleness, mysticism and immorality. Sir Richard Burton, born 21 days earlier, has a very similar horoscope. General Charles &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; Gordon has very exact favorable aspects to his Capricorn Neptune from Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Philosopher and scholar Ernest Renan, with Neptune trine Saturn and sextile the Sun was known as a great and fastidious worker.\n\nWhen malefically aspected in Capricorn, no power in a nativity will successfully save it from some degree of reaction and evil.

It gives that power which Emerson voices perfectly:\n\n> So nigh is grandeur to our dust,\n> So near is God to man,\n> When duty whispers, &lsquo;Lo, thou must,&rsquo;\n> The youth replies &lsquo;I can.&rsquo;\n\nThis majestic force, so readily replying &ldquo;I can,&rdquo; is the flame of conscience from Neptune in Aquarius.\n\nThis impulse of Neptune in Aquarius has had much to do with the practical fulfillment of the research of modern science. Indeed, we owe to this position our major advances of the last century&mdash;the practical development of steam, of electricity, of invention, and of mechanics in general.\n\nThis fine force had also much to do with endowing the leaders of the last French Revolution and the man who followed it. Gambetta had Neptune angular, on the I.C., in Aquarius. So, too, had Felix Faure and Sadi Carnot, and, curiously enough, that grand old figure who not only took part in the revolution which made France a republic, but lived to save her later in the Great War&mdash;Clemenceau, had this same position of Neptune. Indeed, since Neptune left Aquarius, it has no position endowing an equal force to the spiritual will&mdash;giving an equal idealism. Thus France owes much, not only to Clemenceau, but to his Aquarian inspiration and higher vision.\n\nHere in the U.S., Chauncey Depew&apos;s chart shows a strong Aquarius Neptune; Neptune on the Midheaven squares an opposition of the Sun and Moon, and is trine to Saturn. Depew&apos;s career as a Yale student and lawyer was notable for the number of associations to which he belonged; he was an excellent speaker and after entering politics he was eventually honored as the oldest living U.S. Senator. It favors political service, being strong in the chart of Presidential political advisor Mark Hanna. Artists and cartoonists with this Neptune include Alma-Tadema, Cézanne, Degas, Monet, Renoir, Rodin, Rousseau, Du Maurier, and Palmer Cox. Imaginative and prolific humorist Frank R. Stockton had this Neptune sextile Mercury and trine Saturn and the Midheaven. The Swan King of Bavaria, Ludwig II, has Neptune strong on the Midheaven conjunct Mars. Millionaire and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller had Neptune trine a conjunction of Jupiter and Mars.\n\nWhen malefically aspected in this position, the effect is more destinal than psychological, for the effects on character are not marked.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

As Neptune is the ruler of Pisces, it is the most propitious position which this planet can hold. Pisces is a distinctly passive sign, and this is a completely passive position for Neptune. Pisces is also not a sign of great active strength and assertive power; its forces are more negative, receptive, reflectively benefic.\n\nThus, while in its own sign, Neptune does not possess nearly so much power to affect the material plane as in either more active or more material signs. In fact, the very spirituality of the planet and the very psychic passivity of the sign inevitably do not make for strength of manifestation on a physical earth. Thus, as the materialistic Scorpio is the most powerful position of Neptune and the spiritual Sagittarius its next in force, so, the material Capricorn being the weakest position, the psychic Pisces is its next in weakness, viewed from a material standpoint. Otherwise, Pisces might be considered the most powerful position of Neptune.\n\nIn the individual nativity, this position of Neptune in Pisces does not, as a rule, make for singularly dynamic impulses of high, altruistic quality. Most people are too materially active for this passive, psychic force to exert its influence. Unlike the position in Sagittarius, so strongly active, this position has little effect upon the average man, while it may lend force to the extraordinary man. Kaiser Wilhelm II, under whose strong rule Germany prospered for thirty years, had Neptune in Pisces angular in his chart, conjunct both the Midheaven and Mars. The talented comedic wit Oscar Wilde had Neptune in Pisces angular on his Descendant; unfortunately afflicted by a close square from Saturn on the Midheaven; the youthful radiance bestowed by Neptune gave way to imprisonment and a tragic end. Psychiatrist Sigmund Freud had Neptune in Pisces square the Moon but sextile to a Sun-Uranus conjunction. Painter Paul Gauguin had Neptune angular on the Descendant and the focus of a Kite pattern formed by the Moon, Mercury, and Chiron; he was successful as a stockbroker until he decided to escape civilization for the simple life of Tahiti. Desiring to escape to a simpler life is a common theme with people having a strong Neptune.\n\nA malefic Neptune in Pisces gives a craving for narcotics and strong liquor.','Evangeline Adams',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

It can scarcely, of itself, tend to breadth of outlook or adaptability, for the interests will naturally incline to center on the matters of the house that is occupied and the character will be heavily marked with the sign in which the Lights are. It often happens that Mercury and Venus are also one or both in the same sign and house, and the tendency to unbalance is then considerable. Some extremes must therefore be expected: in fire, the emotional nature will be active; in water, the feelings and susceptibilities will be strong; in air, there may be mental coldness or fickleness and caprice; in earth, heaviness and stagnation. Yet these dangers are by no means inevitable.\n\nIt may be surmised that this conjunction does tend to make the native in some way (to use a colloquialism) a whole-hogger, or one whose eggs are all in one basket, whether they are material, emotional, or mental eggs. It is likely that they will be in part emotional in any case, and some degree of self-will and stubbornness is probable, for the pliancy of the Moon is stiffened by the Sun.

I have never seen any suggestion made as to the possible difference between a superior and an inferior conjunction of Mercury or of Venus, but there may be a distinction of values.\n\nIn Raphael&apos;s Guide it is said that the author does not agree that the conjunction of the Sun and Mercury impairs the native&apos;s faculties &ldquo;so far as business or literary ability is concerned, but for clear sound intuitive perception and deep contemplation Mercury is best away from the Sun.&rdquo;\n\nI would rather suggest that the real loss is one of flexibility and impartiality. The native is inclined to be dogmatic, stubborn, and sometimes conceited, with little mental receptivity. The feelings impair the clarity of the mind, and there may be prejudices. The abilities are certainly less than with the Luni-Mercurial conjunction, which can, however, also be prejudiced, especially by racial and family influences.\n\nIt is clear that there is some advantage in having the two bodies in different signs, since this must increase the range of responsiveness.\n\nIn some cases, where the planet appears to predominate, the intellect subdues the animal nature, and there is an ascetic tendency, though a kindly one. More often the animal passions and spirits seek to control the mind, and the native is self-indulgent, usually in a wild, healthy-animal way. In few cases will he brook interference or counsel.\n\nThe mind is generally practical and worldly, seeking objective results even when stimulated by religion. It is self-assured, categorical, and independent in a way reminiscent of Uranian action.\n\nProbably the truth that lies in Raphael&apos;s assertion is that the mind is not sufficiently detached from personal feelings, except, of course, when occupied with pure abstractions&mdash;which in this case will rarely happen.\n\nThe mind is usually healthy and robust, optimistic and vigorous.\n\nIt is a good position for actors and artists generally, for there is a sense of the colorful; it is also good for the exercise of authority of a set and established type.\n\nPsychologically the mind will benefit by the cultivation of adaptability, and by reflections tending to humility, and the advantage of not taking oneself too seriously.','Charles E.O.

Venus is perhaps the most interior of all planets in its action, and is concerned primarily with mental and emotional states, and in particular with the faculty of comparison and with the affections.\n\nAs regards character, the conjunction indicates a warm-hearted, affectionate disposition, and it is also highly conducive to content and cheerfulness, though less so than the conjunction of Mercury and Venus. Since the Sun is debilitated in the positive sign of Venus, it follows that the solar and Venusian influences are dissimilar, the former being in a sense more robust and less delicate and gentle in character. It is sometimes said that the conjunction inclines to effeminacy; but it is more true to say that it denotes an inclination for artistic pursuits and refined conditions, and such a tendency might be considered effeminate by those who are of coarser fiber. The cases of President Hindenburg and Dr. Annie Besant are evidence that by itself the conjunction cannot be of a debilitating character,\n\nIt seems to be sometimes bad for marriage, having a separative effect; and there may be a touch of resentfulness and combativeness in it, since Venus naturally rules the 7th house. It is an indication that a large family is unlikely.\n\nOn the whole I think this aspect is not conducive to worldly achievement, by reason of the rather delicately poised type of character that it signifies. From this must be expected those pursuits, such as the arts, to which Venus is specially akin.

Nevertheless, this energy is frequently expressed in intellectual fields and is by no means always concerned with adventures in the usual sense of this word.\n\nThere is usually strength and hardihood of body, though the physique is often spare and wiry rather than heavy and powerful. There is quick decision, alertness, and ability in all matters appertaining to objective problems. Nothing is too much trouble; the native likes to exercise his powers both physical and mental, and he is never happy unless doing something. He is far happier when busy performing or discussing his own doings than when forced to listen to others. If airy or mutable signs rise, the energy is often intellectual; with watery signs ascending, there is often a &ldquo;psychical&rdquo; expression, i.e. the force of character is seen in the personality, which is of the kind often called magnetic. Regard must also naturally be paid to the signs containing the aspecting bodies themselves, but in any case there will probably be a decisive type of character, knowing well what it thinks, wishes, and intends.\n\nThe profounder Scorpio side of Mars often causes the native to be a seeker after &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; things, a deep thinker, and an incisive, close-knit writer, such as R. W. Emerson (additionally had a Yod pattern focused on 10). It likes epigram and apothegm. The same influence makes the native secretive, having a distinct inner side that is rarely exhibited; it is also productive of personal dignity and self-control. Likewise patient endurance of physical pain comes under this configuration, such as was exemplified by the late Earl Curzon. It may be emphatically said that the aspects of the Sun and Mars are by no means the purely pugnacious and brawn-producing influences that they are sometimes supposed to be; in their highest manifestation they signify the true &ast;hero&ast;, or man who fights, as it were, in the front ranks of mankind for the welfare of the race, a modern Hercules, in the ideal sense of the myth.\n\nI do not think that the conjunction can be differentiated from the trine and sextile, except that it usually denotes some danger of physical injury or disease&mdash;usually the former. It is tremendously hard-working, and may toil on the verge of break-down year after year. On the whole it is beneficial, unless the conjunction itself receives other important bad aspects; but the conjunction will bring some of the deleterious effects of the bad aspects into the life.\n\nThese are likely to be most obvious in physical rather than psychological form, though there is sure to be great excitability, a tendency to run risks and to overwork, a love of hazard, and a headlong precipitate disposition, combative, self-opinionated, often generous-hearted and well-meaning, but without calm, poise, or impartial judgment.','Charles E.O.

In so far as they bring success they do so by means of intellectual achievements more often than in any other way; but they do not care for the competition and hardships of industrial life and prefer to live peaceably, often in circumstances of natural simplicity rather than the opulent state that tradition has rather led us to suppose. Their wants are few and moderate and their pleasures are generally intellectual. Where the native takes part in arduous enterprises Mars will be found prominent.\n\nContrary to what might be expected, it is averse to travelling, or cares but little about it, unless there is an intellectual desire to gratify. It has no restlessness. Such journeys as it likes are of a mild sort, to take a little rest or visit friends for a quiet time.

The self-assertive and self-expressive &ldquo;urge&rdquo; of the native is forced to conform with circumstance, and though in the case of the good aspects this conformity may not be so painful as with the bad ones, and the native may succeed in partially getting his own way, yet the sense of limitation is not likely to be altogether absent.\n\nThe highest significance of the contact is, perhaps, profound and painstaking thought, a moral, well-ordered life, and wise, well-considered actions. There is a strong constructive tendency and a desire to ordinate which may appear in an intellectual form (e.g. a desire to philosophize or ordinate the mental life), or in the desire to govern and shape the destinies of communities, or to build up and control great businesses.\n\nThe powerful influence of the conjunction may produce well-earned material success and respect, as in the case of the Indian judge, Sir Gooroodar Banerji, described in Notable Nativities as &ldquo;a self-made man in the truest sense.&rdquo; In such instances the blending of the two opposite influences is successfully achieved, and the vigor of the Sun is coordinated and directed by Saturn.\n\nIn other cases the same conjunction appears to operate to cause seclusion and work done in private.\n\nThe father is commonly found to be domineering, cold, without much interest in or affection for the native, and he is frequently unfortunate in his affairs.

In other types, when the benefic element is pronounced, the native may be idle and irresponsible, incapable of handling serious matters in the right spirit. If the Sun is the stronger this type is often found, and duty is neglected; if Saturn is the stronger, then life is all duty and the voice of the heart is stifled.\n\nIn women&apos;s maps Sun-Saturn contacts work largely through the fathers and husbands and other male associates; these are often engrossed in business, politics, or local government, attaining prominence, but not always proving equally successful in the domestic sphere.','Charles E.O.

The personality appears to emanate some kind of magnetism that attracts and holds. It is not always tactful; but there is breadth of vision and stability of purpose; the native is often identified with some cause or movement; he does not waver or fluctuate in his aims and opinions; there is nothing in him of the opportunist (unless other aspects bestow this), and as a result people feel that he stands for something definite, and can be depended on. But, while not of a time-serving temper, the Sun-Uranus man has a keen and true sense of the dramatic, and may often be a most convincing and powerful orator, there being great reserves of nervous and emotional strength, and a burning zeal.\n\nThe Conjunction of these bodies is a powerful configuration with an influence not dissimilar from the harmonious aspects, but liable, if the rest of the horoscope inclines in that direction, to some of the features of the malefic aspects, such as rebelliousness, perverseness, and obstinate persistence in unwise courses.\n\nIn seems to favor a scientific or literary career; it is averse to conventional occupations and must be permitted to make its own way in life.\n\nSince the planet is said to rule, or to have marked affinity with, Aquarius, which is the detriment of the Sun, it may be supposed that the two have little sympathy.

Very many writers and artists have this combination and probably owe much to it. There are also many followers of the way of mysticism, as well as philanthropists and humanitarians. The love of animals is commonly very strong: this is usually the case even when the bodies are in affliction, though there may then be excess of feeling, sentimentality, etc. Horses are particularly liked. But besides this side, the combination may be perfectly practical (it has been said that the genuine mystic is the most practical of persons, as, for example, Joan of Arc). It occurs in empire-builders, great financiers, and industrialists, and others who have &ldquo;visions&rdquo; of a distinctly profitable kind.\n\nThe conjunction inclines strongly to matters of which the essential characteristic seems to be delicacy or remoteness from what is ordinary, tangible, and concrete. Music is very commonly the main interest and pursuit, and other forms of art are often followed, in particular the drama.

In these it may go with considerable success, fame, and recognition, but it inclines to scandal and the native is likely to be the victim of rumors and tales of a subtle character, emanating from sources hard to detect and expose. These attacks are generally directed against the moral character and are sometimes of a particularly odious kind, especially if the 5th or 11th house be involved.\n\nThe father is sometimes involved in dubious affairs or may be engaged in Neptunian matters; or, again, there may be some mystery or strange circumstance connected with him.\n\nIn women&apos;s maps there is often either widowhood or spinsterhood.','Charles E.O.

An exception to this is Lord Beaconsfield (Disraeli), whose Martian asc. gave him the grit and courage that Sun trine Moon would have denied; however, it is noteworthy that he also sought success as an author. The Prince of Wales (Edward, Duke of Windsor), who certainly does not avoid dangers, has the Sun squared by Mars. Otherwise the trine seeks ways of peace and quietude.\n\nIt is an influence which points to a comfortable home and much mutual understanding between native and marriage partner. Where this is otherwise, aspects to the Lights and to Venus must of course be considered, together with the 7th house. In the same way it is likely to denote a happy life with the parents.\n\nIt is an influence that signifies a general harmony in the nature, settled and congenial interests, and an absence of the inner conflicts that occur with the inharmonious contacts. The inherited disposition, training, and upbringing are not hostile to the pursuits and interests that are taken up voluntarily as the life develops; the adult life tends to grow naturally out of the early years. There is not likely to be a violent breaking away from home conditions, or, if there is something of this sort, re-adjustment ensues speedily and readily. Many of the benefits of these aspects are subconscious and ingrained, and they are therefore not always obvious, especially to the native himself.\n\nAny kind of contact causes the native&apos;s life to be intimately connected with that of his family, or, sometimes, with his partner&apos;s family, though the relation may be psychological rather than material. Sometimes there is a distinctly patriotic aspect to the contacts, and the native is politically minded. Again, they incline to domestic and landed interests and are excellent for all pursuits that are connected with house-property or with appliances that are of a domestic character.\n\nSometimes the vocation is carried on at home, or in homes, as for example is often the case with a physician. Often the partner either helps the native directly, or shares his interests.','Charles E.O. Carter',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Nevertheless, this energy is frequently expressed in intellectual fields and is by no means always concerned with adventures in the usual sense of this word.\n\nThere is usually strength and hardihood of body, though the physique is often spare and wiry rather than heavy and powerful. There is quick decision, alertness, and ability in all matters appertaining to objective problems. Nothing is too much trouble; the native likes to exercise his powers both physical and mental, and he is never happy unless doing something. He is far happier when busy performing or discussing his own doings than when forced to listen to others. If airy or mutable signs rise, the energy is often intellectual; with watery signs ascending, there is often a &ldquo;psychical&rdquo; expression, i.e. the force of character is seen in the personality, which is of the kind often called magnetic. Regard must also naturally be paid to the signs containing the aspecting bodies themselves, but in any case there will probably be a decisive type of character, knowing well what it thinks, wishes, and intends.\n\nThe profounder Scorpio side of Mars often causes the native to be a seeker after &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; things, a deep thinker, and an incisive, close-knit writer, such as R. W. Emerson (had a Yod pattern focused on 10). It likes epigram and apothegm. The same influence makes the native secretive, having a distinct inner side that is rarely exhibited; it is also productive of personal dignity and self-control. Likewise patient endurance of physical pain comes under this configuration, such as was exemplified by the late Earl Curzon. It may be emphatically said that the aspects of the Sun and Mars are by no means the purely pugnacious and brawn-producing influences that they are sometimes supposed to be; in their highest manifestation they signify the true &ast;hero&ast;, or man who fights, as it were, in the front ranks of mankind for the welfare of the race, a modern Hercules, in the ideal sense of the myth.\n\nNote that even the harmonious contacts usually bring some of the effects more often ascribed to the inharmonious, especially if either body is weak by sign or by other aspects. But these are likely to fall short of actual harm and may be rather of the nature of narrow escapes. For example, Lord Roberts was in the utmost danger when he won his Victoria Cross.','Charles E.O.

In so far as they bring success they do so by means of intellectual achievements more often than in any other way; but they do not care for the competition and hardships of industrial life and prefer to live peaceably, often in circumstances of natural simplicity rather than the opulent state that tradition has rather led us to suppose. Their wants are few and moderate and their pleasures are generally intellectual. Where the native takes part in arduous enterprises (as James II, an able admiral prior to his coronation) Mars will be found prominent.\n\nIt is a good aspect for the sea and all things connected therewith, as well as for law, publishing, religion, foreign lands, and all other matters of the 9th house, as well as for those of the 12th.\n\nIt is of interest to see that both Wilhelm II of Germany and President Ebert had this trine in the same signs. Wilhelm was certainly a religious man, though the debility of both bodies made his religion distorted. He was also brilliant intellectually.\n\nI have known Sun trine Jupiter men who lived cheerfully in poverty, possessing almost nothing except books, good spirits, and moderate health. It is the least personally ambitious of any configuration and can even be shy.\n\nFrom an external point of view it is highly beneficent and protective, so that the native is very rarely in want of anything; his simple needs are usually supplied, sometimes, as it were, providentially. In the same way it protects against ill-health and accidents, and it is a powerful aid in combating the effects of any malefic aspects.\n\nContrary to what might be expected, it is averse to travelling, or cares but little about it, unless there is an intellectual desire to gratify. It has no restlessness. Such journeys as it likes are of a mild sort, to take a little rest or visit friends for a quiet time. I have noticed that even highly intelligent men, possessing ease and leisure, travel little if they have this contact, although one might suppose that a desire for experience and knowledge of the world would cause them to visit distant lands and peoples.

The self-assertive and self-expressive &ldquo;urge&rdquo; of the native is forced to conform with circumstance, and though in the case of the good aspects this conformity may not be so painful as with the bad ones, and the native may succeed in partially getting his own way, yet the sense of limitation is not likely to be altogether absent.\n\nThe highest significance of the contact is, perhaps, profound and painstaking thought, a moral, well-ordered life, and wise, well-considered actions. There is a strong constructive tendency and a desire to ordinate which may appear in an intellectual form (e.g. a desire to philosophize or ordinate the mental life), or in the desire to govern and shape the destinies of communities, or to build up and control great businesses.\n\nEven the good aspects place heavy responsibilities on the native, which he may not be entirely adequate to support. What they may bestow is nearly always the result of hard work and patience, and fortune rarely comes by a stroke of luck.\n\nIn women&apos;s maps Sun-Saturn contacts work largely through the fathers and husbands and other male associates; these are often engrossed in business, politics, or local government, attaining prominence, but not always proving equally successful in the domestic sphere.\n\nIn both sexes a strong, good aspect may produce industrious, worthy, and successful sons, but if there is the least concomitant affliction the reverse may happen, and children may be few (especially few boys) or they are of little help to the native.\n\nThe good aspects tend to preserve life and health, especially in old age, and they prevent accidents through prudence and circumspection.','Charles E.O.

Moreover, it is a very popular configuration, and the native is readily liked and obeyed, sometimes by reason of his mental or other powers, but more often by his personality, which appears to emanate some kind of magnetism that attracts and holds. It is not always tactful; but there is breadth of vision and stability of purpose; the native is often identified with some cause or movement; he does not waver or fluctuate in his aims and opinions; there is nothing in him of the opportunist (unless other aspects bestow this), and as a result people feel that he stands for something definite, and can be depended on. But, while not of a time-serving temper, the Sun-Uranus man has a keen and true sense of the dramatic, and may often be a most convincing and powerful orator, there being great reserves of nervous and emotional strength, and a burning zeal.\n\nAs a ruler it is efficient, scientific, despotic, but not unbending or automatic; it has feeling, and can be appealed to on the emotional side, especially if the cause that is pleaded has a dramatic aspect.\n\nSo far as feeling goes, Uranus tends to a rough-and-ready, careless good-nature. Uranus rising is usually kind but rather casual and off-hand.\n\nIt differs diametrically from Sun-Neptune in its love of power, responsibility, and publicity.\n\nIt occurs constantly in the nativities of statesmen, generals, municipal officials, civil servants, and, to a lesser extent and in combination with other planets, in those of eminent thinkers.','Charles E.O.

Very many writers and artists have this combination and probably owe much to it. There are also many followers of the way of mysticism, as well as philanthropists and humanitarians. The love of animals is commonly very strong: this is usually the case even when the bodies are in affliction, though there may then be excess of feeling, sentimentality, etc. Horses are particularly liked. But besides this side, the combination may be perfectly practical (it has been said that the genuine mystic is the most practical of persons, as, for example, Joan of Arc). It occurs in empire-builders, great financiers, and industrialists, and others who have &ldquo;visions&rdquo; of a distinctly profitable kind.\n\nIt goes without saying that all Neptune aspects incline to relations with water and the sea.\n\nThese aspects seem markedly to favor the self-made man, although one may say that most people with a strong solar aspect make or seek to make something of their lives for themselves.\n\nThe most illusive side of the contacts occurs in the cases of mediumistic or psychistic tendencies, though these are commoner under the conjunction and inharmonious contacts. &ldquo;Charubel,&rdquo; the astrologer-clairvoyant, had a sextile of the Sun and Neptune; William Blake had a trine. We must let the reader judge the work of these two men for himself, sincere as each undoubtedly was. The task of Sun-Neptune is to see visions and to actualize them; the prayer &ldquo;Thy Kingdom come&rdquo; is the essence of the aspects of these bodies, and their favorable aspects frequently indicate the capacity to do work of this kind in an unusual and even unique manner.\n\nIn practical affairs these aspects are favorable wherever vision and foresight are called for, but the native will be happiest and most successful when he can formulate an imaginary picture of the task that he has to do, an ideal pattern to which to work; and the more entrancing and far-flung it is, the more it will draw him on to its fulfillment.\n\nThe native&apos;s father may be Neptunian in character, and may be a visionary or one engaged on mystical or occult work; or he may follow the sea or some other Neptune livelihood.

The professional work may be distasteful and may conflict with the real interests of the native; on the other hand, the domestic life may not be tranquil, and the two are often in some kind of antagonism. The same division may occur as between the two parents, or between the father and his work. At some time there will be trouble with the opposite sex, and often an affair, or even marriage, with a person of different tastes and interests, and possibly of a radically different character. It is a position of incompatibility, both inner and outer, and the inner strife may be reflected in brusque and rude manners, or in an uncertain and changeful demeanor. It makes for unpopularity, or sometimes for alternations of favor and disfavor, and the native may be much liked by some and much assailed by others-in the latter case, often by Leo persons and those in authority.

There is quick decision, alertness, and ability in all matters appertaining to objective problems. Nothing is too much trouble; the native likes to exercise his powers both physical and mental, and he is never happy unless doing something. He is far happier when busy performing or discussing his own doings than when forced to listen to others.\n\nThe inharmonious nature of the square is likely to be most obvious in physical rather than psychological form, though there is sure to be great excitability, a tendency to run risks and to overwork, a love of hazard, and a headlong precipitate disposition, combative, self-opinionated, often generous-hearted and well-meaning, but without calm, poise, or impartial judgment.\n\nIn some cases the native espouses causes and has a conviction that he ought to lead crusades and seek the reformation of everyone and everything (except perhaps himself); in other cases the quarrel is more personal and is with individuals. One meets types who seem incapable of agreeing to any statement; there is always a desire to contradict or at least to modify. It is said that it takes two to make a quarrel, but people with this configuration sometimes seem as if, failing any other antagonist, they would almost set one hand against the other. But, as with good contacts, this predisposition is often expressed in mental form rather than physical, especially if the body is too frail to encourage the latter. It is an influence which seems to force the native to fight something, and even if he is a convinced pacifist he will be a militant one. In religion there is a love of military forms, and the conception of being a &ldquo;soldier&rdquo; of God is a favorite one.\n\nPolitics, military exploits, boating, sport, and debating are all common pursuits.\n\nThese afflictions (especially the square) are common in criminal maps and probably lead to evil courses by their imprudent, hasty tendency and their lack of restraining imagination; I do not consider the contacts in themselves actually immoral or even cruel, but they do not promote the cultivation of the finer feelings, because of their restlessness and objectivism.\n\nThere is less probability of disease, I think, than of accidents and strain through over-work. I know a man with Sun square Mars who has never missed a day&apos;s work in his life, though he has had several serious strains and is not strong. The heart may be affected, but not necessarily gravely. Such complaints as may arise are usually acute, painful, but not prolonged.\n\nThe children of the native seems as a rule to be few and they are likely to be of a Martian type in some respect and to be liable to febrile complaints and accidents.

The mental powers are often good, as the examples below will confirm, but they are frequently used on behalf of unpopular or unconventional causes, or in such a way as to do the native but little good in a worldly sense. There is a fatal tendency to imprudence, carelessness, love of hazard, and blind optimism : they may result in serious loss and financial or social entanglements. There is often a youthful and boyish freshness that is quite as pleasant to behold as the steadier effects of the trine and sextile; but this juvenility may lead to catastrophes when it means that there is a young head on old shoulders and the responsibilities of age are carried in the spirit of the schoolboy.\n\nThey are adventurous and get into strange places and they do not care for grooves or drudgery at all, in this respect contrasting with the tranquil good contacts.\n\nThey are prone to ignore authority and convention and can be opinionated and rebellious. Sometimes there is a tendency to vainglory and show, but this depends, for its outward manifestation, on Saturn, which may restrain open ostentation and relegate this propensity to the &ldquo;unconscious,&rdquo; whence may arise harmless but foolish dreams of pomp and circumstance.\n\nThe good nature is perceptibly less than with the favorable aspects; it can be selfish and lazy, except when engaged on its own activities. It is less religious but more superstitious and prone to &ldquo;cults.&rdquo; It has not the quiet good breeding of the other aspects.\n\nNor does it appear to be fond of the simple life, though a faulty liver may drive it to temporary abstentions. It may be alternately mean and wasteful, gluttonous and ascetic.\n\nIt seems to gain most from good Saturnine contacts, either to the Sun or Jupiter. The more profuse and precipitate sides of the influence are then held in check, and though there will certainly be trouble of the 9th and 12th house order, this may be less the native&apos;s fault than his misfortune, and may ultimately be surmounted by patience and care. Even faulty Saturnian action, if prominent, may do something to neutralize an afflicted Jupiter, as two poisons may act as antidotes one to another. But if Saturn be not so much afflicted as weak in action, both good and bad, the results may be serious.\n\nThe cultivation of a steady, matter-of-fact attitude may be advised, and a constant determination to seek only what has been earned by honest work. It will be well to distrust all who offer short-cuts to success or attainment, or who paint things in roseate colors, appealing to the gambling and get-rich-quick tendencies. The same applies to those false prophets who promise &ldquo;occult&rdquo; or falsely so-called &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; attainments as the result of &ldquo;stunts&rdquo; The native will often be tempted with specious, unsound things, and the results may be grave, for the 12th house side of Jupiter must not be forgotten&mdash;self-undoing.\n\nThe evil effects will be materially lessened in a generally good map, or if the Sun and Jupiter are otherwise well placed, as by sign and aspect. In any case, a contact of any sort with Jupiter tends to lift the native above the sordid and commonplace&mdash;if only in imagination.\n\nThe effects on the health are chiefly due to imprudence and excess in diet and to a defective action of the liver with consequent toxemia. It tends to gout and obesity. Generally speaking there is need for an active and abstemious life, but the native will probably dislike this prospect and practice restraint too fitfully, if at all.','Charles E.O.

He may be hard or unsuccessful or a reprobate. A case in point is that of the ex-Kaiser, whose father ruled only for a short time, died of cancer, and was never intimate with his son. I have a case of a man with Sun square Saturn who as a child was obliged to fetch his father from the public-house regularly&mdash;he grew up a person of staunch moral character, worked extremely hard all his life, and, after severe checks, accumulated a moderate fortune. Here the native&apos;s life was embittered because, though fairly successful, he did not attain his ambitions, which were considerable. In other cases known to me the Sun-Saturn native has achieved a great deal in terms of social status, but not in actual tangible cash. Again, the inhibition is sometimes largely physical (cf. the ex-Kaiser&apos;s withered arm).\n\nWe may distinguish three types : the ambitious but incompetent man who &ldquo;fails,&rdquo; the man who is not ambitious or interested in material affairs, but has to spend his life with them, and the competent and ambitious man who is confronted with obstacles and ill-luck. Often it seems as if this third class does not suffer much discontent from the fact that he has to work hard for comparatively little emolument; in a word, he accepts the Saturnian destiny philosophically and becomes a willing, if not a cheerful, captive of the planet&apos;s regime, finding a sort of satisfaction in the fact that he earns every penny he gets, and sometimes a good deal more. But this will depend upon the general tenor of the map, and especially upon the nature of the ascendant. In a case of the Sun squared by Saturn in Aquarius I have found the native very cheerful in poverty, bearing it in an idealistic spirit.\n\nThe difficulty is always, at heart, one of self-expression. Either proper expression is denied or delayed until it is almost too late to serve its purpose, or else the native tries &ldquo;to force the issue&rdquo; and blunders disastrously. Sometimes the issue is shirked and there is shyness or timidity, which may be hidden behind blatant boastfulness.\n\nChildren being part of our means of self-expression, this contact is evil for them, especially for the eldest, if a male. It may deny boys when these are badly wanted or one of them (usually the eldest) may die, be sickly, or suffer in his fortunes. If there are no boys then it sometimes affects the eldest girl. In a male natus the Sun was trine a debilitated Saturn, and the native had four girls, but no boys, and the eldest underwent a long and serious illness. In a female natus, with a similar trine, there were four girls and then a boy, who was not strong, although all his sisters were robust. In the former of these cases it should be mentioned that the wife had Sun opp. Saturn.\n\nIn women&apos;s maps the husband sometimes exemplifies the affliction by being weak and unfortunate, and there is often much difference of age and social status. In the case just cited the husband was considerably older and (from the wife&apos;s point of view) much immersed in business, while the father had been repeatedly unsuccessful in business.\n\nThe Sun afflicted by Saturn is extremely likely, in a female map, to deny offspring altogether and even to indicate a single condition.\n\nWith respect to health the afflictions cause debility, catarrhal conditions, colds, tubercular tendencies, and maladies of the bones. In regard to accidents it is well known that Saturn inclines to falls, especially if his action falls near the middle of the cardinal signs, the central point of this influence being about the 17th degrees. But by reason of its prudent character the planet is less likely to cause accidents than Mars or Uranus, and as a rule in these cases one or both of the latter intermingle their rays. Similarly in cases of severe dental trouble.','Charles E.O. Carter',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

However, unless the horoscope contains other mitigating features, the inharmonious contacts are likely to be of an unfortunate nature, even to the extent of catastrophe.\n\nThe self-will of the native is likely to be extreme and the judgment is perverse, refusing, when the self-will is aroused, to take account of the most patent and important facts. Sometimes the afflicted-Uranus person is, as it were, impelled from without to work his own destruction or injury. Vanity, morbid sensitiveness, and wrong-headedness of every kind characterize this class of aspects : if the native is a genius, it will rob him of many of the rewards of genius; if he is capable, he will still, by some foolish act, destroy the fruits of his own work, perhaps after much labor and effort. Even if he is personally amiable, he will still be stubborn, misguided, and fickle. The views, interests, and pursuits are liable to be completely changed, abruptly and often frequently.\n\nIn women it is certainly less dangerous than in men, but it indicates high nervous tension sometimes bordering on the hysterical; and if they are called on to exercise authority the same tendency will be seen to &ldquo;take hold of the wrong end of the stick&rdquo; and to be their own enemy, by some uncalled-for and unnecessary ineptitude. It is not in everyday life that this affliction will generally appear; it will act only occasionally, but often at the most critical times.\n\nIn matters of health it inclines to nervous complaints and also to deep-rooted and obscure ailments.\n\nIt is a common contact in the maps of leaders of &ldquo;occult&rdquo; movements and peculiar cults; but it is an aspect of discord and disruption, and none the less so because such people frequently preach &ldquo;brotherhood&rdquo; before all things, the benefits of this fraternal feeling being as a rule exclusively reserved for those who are prepared to &ldquo;feed out of the hand&rdquo; of the teacher! As a general rule they are difficult people to be on the wrong side of, and in such circumstances can be &ldquo;good haters.&rdquo; In Sun-Uranus there is rarely the humility and self-forgetfulness of the true mystic, although in this respect the square is better than the opposition, and, of course, careful attention must be paid, as always, to the rest of the map.\n\nWhere there is no support from other bodies there can be no doubt that these aspects call for great self-control of the feeling side of the nature, as well as a strenuous effort to maintain mental balance and common-sense. The native cannot be too careful to avoid precipitate action, especially when the feelings are aroused. Above all, the tendency to indulge in inflated fancies of the kind that panders to personal vanity must be avoided, for the dramatic proclivities of the harmonious aspects appear in the inharmonious ones in the guise of self-glorifying impulses, which may have serious results if the rest of the map is of the same kind. There is usually a complete lack of humor in so far as the native is the target thereof.\n\nIt is not a criminal contact and appears to indicate peril to the emotional nature rather than the passional. Further, it may be conceded that it is commonly found in the maps of gifted people, though they may be eccentric and have the other failings here mentioned. Again the ideals may be high and the intentions of the best, nor are they ever cunning or underhanded. They may organize well, and it may be said that often a person with the inharmonious contacts will for a long period behave as wisely and successfully as if he had the harmonious : then he will perhaps suddenly and without reason go off at a tangent and either abandon or gravely injure the construction he has raised.

He seldom realizes his own motives and may in extreme cases even think that he is acting the part of martyr or saint when he is in fact gratifying his self-approbation. There is a craving for something great, wonderful, and out of the ordinary, but there is not the ability or the wisdom to pursue what is genuinely possessed of these attributes, and those who bait the hook with specious promises can usually fish for the native successfully.

Those who seek &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; powers, as they are called, who wish to &ldquo;get into touch with the Masters&rdquo; by stunt-exercises, seek to become &ldquo;great healers,&rdquo; and otherwise succumb to the delusive claptrap that is now heard on all sides for the edification of well-intentioned but misguided people-these are commonly found to have Sun-Neptune afflictions.\n\nSpiritists commonly have these configurations, and they occur also in the horoscopes of Christian Scientists, vegetarians, conscientious objectors, and others, who frequently are actuated by the noblest motives, but, in the case of those with the afflictions, either carry their ideals to injudicious extremes or suffer through the opposition of others or the excesses of their associates, with no apparent fault on their own part.\n\nSometimes extreme sensitiveness to suffering, and resultant painful experiences, characterize these people.\n\nThe tendency of Neptune to produce scandal is often seen; sometimes the native is to blame, sometimes apparently not. Often the whole affair is involved in mystery, and no one seems to know the truth about it.\n\nAgain, while some Sun-Neptunian people are muddlers, others are very careful and painstaking, but either have confused conditions thrust upon them by force of circumstance, or at some point in their lives their prudence seems strangely to desert them, and a long train of disorder has to be worked out.\n\nSympathy, kindliness, and love of animals are very pronounced. They are nearly always &ldquo;good sorts.&rdquo; Excess of emotion is their peril; their desire-nature seems very easily stimulated and attracted, and they seem then to lack patience and to seek short cuts to their goals, inclining to scamp details and blind themselves to existing obstacles, facts, and conditions. The same trait seems to make them sometimes oblivious to the laws of conventional morality and straight-forwardness, not perhaps so often deliberately as by reason of a seeming &ldquo;blind spot.&rdquo;\n\nNeptune often causes people to be officious and overfond of proffering unasked advice and (in popular parlance) of preaching sermons : it does often literally produce preachers.\n\nThe inharmonious aspects are evil for the father, who is sometimes domineering and selfish, or may be unfortunate, irresponsible in the Neptunian way, or may die young.\n\nIt causes worry through the children.\n\nWomen with this contact may be advised to be especially careful in respect of their male associates, as they are nearly certain to meet morally instable characters, and, very often, men who are the reverse of what they seem. Drink is a common danger.\n\nIn all practical affairs the native has to guard constantly against deception and will be well advised to avoid all Neptunian interests or occupations, such as those connected with shipping, canals, water-supply, breweries, narcotics, lotteries, tobacco interests, substitute and artificial articles (e.g. artificial silk), marine cables, fishing, rubber, and sleep (e.g. bedding). The various pursuits that are related to the so-called astral plane should be scrupulously avoided, or investigated only in a strictly scientific and detached spirit. He cannot be too particular to keep his affairs in order and avoid everything that is not absolutely above-board and free from the possibility of misconstruction. Further, it is well to keep an eye open for all persons who may approach the native in connection with Neptune things, or who may by their habits or appearance give him reason to suspect Neptunian characteristics, promising something for nothing, or much for little. Motives and characters must be rigidly scrutinized.\n\nSobriety, in the widest sense, is needed to enable one to steer through the rocks and currents of this contact. It is hardly necessary to say that a good Saturn is the best prophylactic.','Charles E.O. Carter',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

They make for popularity, with the opposite sex and with the world at large. They do not make for a very vigorous or ambitious life in a public sense, but there may be considerable success without much open struggle or conflict. An exception to this is Lord Beaconsfield (Disraeli), whose Martian asc. gave him the grit and courage that Sun trine Moon would have denied; however, it is noteworthy that he also sought success as an author. The Prince of Wales (Edward, Duke of Windsor), who certainly does not avoid dangers, has the Sun squared by Mars. Otherwise the trine seeks ways of peace and quietude.\n\nIt is an influence which points to a comfortable home and much mutual understanding between native and marriage partner. Where this is otherwise, aspects to the Lights and to Venus must of course be considered, together with the 7th house. In the same way it is likely to denote a happy life with the parents.\n\nIt is an influence that signifies a general harmony in the nature, settled and congenial interests, and an absence of the inner conflicts that occur with the inharmonious contacts. The inherited disposition, training, and upbringing are not hostile to the pursuits and interests that are taken up voluntarily as the life develops; the adult life tends to grow naturally out of the early years. There is not likely to be a violent breaking away from home conditions, or, if there is something of this sort, re-adjustment ensues speedily and readily. Many of the benefits of these aspects are subconscious and ingrained, and they are therefore not always obvious, especially to the native himself.\n\nAny kind of contact causes the native&apos;s life to be intimately connected with that of his family, or, sometimes, with his partner&apos;s family, though the relation may be psychological rather than material. Sometimes there is a distinctly patriotic aspect to the contacts, and the native is politically minded. Again, they incline to domestic and landed interests and are excellent for all pursuits that are connected with house-property or with appliances that are of a domestic character.\n\nSometimes the vocation is carried on at home, or in homes, as for example is often the case with a physician.

Nevertheless, this energy is frequently expressed in intellectual fields and is by no means always concerned with adventures in the usual sense of this word.\n\nThere is usually strength and hardihood of body, though the physique is often spare and wiry rather than heavy and powerful. There is quick decision, alertness, and ability in all matters appertaining to objective problems. Nothing is too much trouble; the native likes to exercise his powers both physical and mental, and he is never happy unless doing something. He is far happier when busy performing or discussing his own doings than when forced to listen to others. If airy or mutable signs rise, the energy is often intellectual; with watery signs ascending, there is often a &ldquo;psychical&rdquo; expression, i.e. the force of character is seen in the personality, which is of the kind often called magnetic. Regard must also naturally be paid to the signs containing the aspecting bodies themselves, but in any case there will probably be a decisive type of character, knowing well what it thinks, wishes, and intends.\n\nThe profounder Scorpio side of Mars often causes the native to be a seeker after &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; things, a deep thinker, and an incisive, close-knit writer, such as R. W. Emerson (had a Yod pattern focused on 10). It likes epigram and apothegm. The same influence makes the native secretive, having a distinct inner side that is rarely exhibited; it is also productive of personal dignity and self-control. Likewise patient endurance of physical pain comes under this configuration, such as was exemplified by the late Earl Curzon. It may be emphatically said that the aspects of the Sun and Mars are by no means the purely pugnacious and brawn-producing influences that they are sometimes supposed to be; in their highest manifestation they signify the true &ast;hero&ast;, or man who fights, as it were, in the front ranks of mankind for the welfare of the race, a modern Hercules, in the ideal sense of the myth.\n\nNote that even the harmonious contacts usually bring some of the effects more often ascribed to the inharmonious, especially if either body is weak by sign or by other aspects.

In so far as they bring success they do so by means of intellectual achievements more often than in any other way; but they do not care for the competition and hardships of industrial life and prefer to live peaceably, often in circumstances of natural simplicity rather than the opulent state that tradition has rather led us to suppose. Their wants are few and moderate and their pleasures are generally intellectual. Where the native takes part in arduous enterprises (as James II, an able admiral prior to his coronation) Mars will be found prominent.\n\nIt is a good aspect for the sea and all things connected therewith, as well as for law, publishing, religion, foreign lands, and all other matters of the 9th house, as well as for those of the 12th.\n\nIt is of interest to see that both Wilhelm II of Germany and President Ebert had this trine in the same signs.

In the same way it protects against ill-health and accidents, and it is a powerful aid in combating the effects of any malefic aspects.\n\nContrary to what might be expected, it is averse to travelling, or cares but little about it, unless there is an intellectual desire to gratify. It has no restlessness. Such journeys as it likes are of a mild sort, to take a little rest or visit friends for a quiet time. I have noticed that even highly intelligent men, possessing ease and leisure, travel little if they have this contact, although one might suppose that a desire for experience and knowledge of the world would cause them to visit distant lands and peoples.

The self-assertive and self-expressive &ldquo;urge&rdquo; of the native is forced to conform with circumstance, and though in the case of the good aspects this conformity may not be so painful as with the bad ones, and the native may succeed in partially getting his own way, yet the sense of limitation is not likely to be altogether absent.\n\nThe highest significance of the contact is, perhaps, profound and painstaking thought, a moral, well-ordered life, and wise, well-considered actions. There is a strong constructive tendency and a desire to ordinate which may appear in an intellectual form (e.g. a desire to philosophize or ordinate the mental life), or in the desire to govern and shape the destinies of communities, or to build up and control great businesses.\n\nEven the good aspects place heavy responsibilities on the native, which he may not be entirely adequate to support.

Moreover, it is a very popular configuration, and the native is readily liked and obeyed, sometimes by reason of his mental or other powers, but more often by his personality, which appears to emanate some kind of magnetism that attracts and holds. It is not always tactful; but there is breadth of vision and stability of purpose; the native is often identified with some cause or movement; he does not waver or fluctuate in his aims and opinions; there is nothing in him of the opportunist (unless other aspects bestow this), and as a result people feel that he stands for something definite, and can be depended on.

Very many writers and artists have this combination and probably owe much to it. There are also many followers of the way of mysticism, as well as philanthropists and humanitarians. The love of animals is commonly very strong: this is usually the case even when the bodies are in affliction, though there may then be excess of feeling, sentimentality, etc. Horses are particularly liked. But besides this side, the combination may be perfectly practical (it has been said that the genuine mystic is the most practical of persons, as, for example, Joan of Arc).

We must let the reader judge the work of these two men for himself, sincere as each undoubtedly was. The task of Sun-Neptune is to see visions and to actualize them; the prayer &ldquo;Thy Kingdom come&rdquo; is the essence of the aspects of these bodies, and their favorable aspects frequently indicate the capacity to do work of this kind in an unusual and even unique manner.\n\nIn practical affairs these aspects are favorable wherever vision and foresight are called for, but the native will be happiest and most successful when he can formulate an imaginary picture of the task that he has to do, an ideal pattern to which to work; and the more entrancing and far-flung it is, the more it will draw him on to its fulfillment.\n\nThe native&apos;s father may be Neptunian in character, and may be a visionary or one engaged on mystical or occult work; or he may follow the sea or some other Neptune livelihood.

The professional work may be distasteful and may conflict with the real interests of the native; on the other hand, the domestic life may not be tranquil, and the two are often in some kind of antagonism. The same division may occur as between the two parents, or between the father and his work. At some time there will be trouble with the opposite sex, and often an affair, or even marriage, with a person of different tastes and interests, and possibly of a radically different character. It is a position of incompatibility, both inner and outer, and the inner strife may be reflected in brusque and rude manners, or in an uncertain and changeful demeanor. It makes for unpopularity, or sometimes for alternations of favor and disfavor, and the native may be much liked by some and much assailed by others-in the latter case, often by Leo persons and those in authority.

He is far happier when busy performing or discussing his own doings than when forced to listen to others.\n\nThe inharmonious nature of the opposition is likely to be most obvious in physical rather than psychological form, though there is sure to be great excitability, a tendency to run risks and to overwork, a love of hazard, and a headlong precipitate disposition, combative, self-opinionated, often generous-hearted and well-meaning, but without calm, poise, or impartial judgment.\n\nIn some cases the native espouses causes and has a conviction that he ought to lead crusades and seek the reformation of everyone and everything (except perhaps himself); in other cases the quarrel is more personal and is with individuals. One meets types who seem incapable of agreeing to any statement; there is always a desire to contradict or at least to modify. It is said that it takes two to make a quarrel, but people with this configuration sometimes seem as if, failing any other antagonist, they would almost set one hand against the other. But, as with good contacts, this predisposition is often expressed in mental form rather than physical, especially if the body is too frail to encourage the latter. It is an influence which seems to force the native to fight something, and even if he is a convinced pacifist he will be a militant one. In religion there is a love of military forms, and the conception of being a &ldquo;soldier&rdquo; of God is a favorite one.\n\nPolitics, military exploits, boating, sport, and debating are all common pursuits.\n\nThese afflictions (especially the square) are common in criminal maps and probably lead to evil courses by their imprudent, hasty tendency and their lack of restraining imagination; I do not consider the contacts in themselves actually immoral or even cruel, but they do not promote the cultivation of the finer feelings, because of their restlessness and objectivism.\n\nThere is less probability of disease, I think, than of accidents and strain through over-work. I know a man with Sun square Mars who has never missed a day&apos;s work in his life, though he has had several serious strains and is not strong. The heart may be affected, but not necessarily gravely. Such complaints as may arise are usually acute, painful, but not prolonged.\n\nThe children of the native seems as a rule to be few and they are likely to be of a Martian type in some respect and to be liable to febrile complaints and accidents.

The mental powers are often good, as the examples below will confirm, but they are frequently used on behalf of unpopular or unconventional causes, or in such a way as to do the native but little good in a worldly sense. There is a fatal tendency to imprudence, carelessness, love of hazard, and blind optimism : they may result in serious loss and financial or social entanglements. There is often a youthful and boyish freshness that is quite as pleasant to behold as the steadier effects of the trine and sextile; but this juvenility may lead to catastrophes when it means that there is a young head on old shoulders and the responsibilities of age are carried in the spirit of the schoolboy.\n\nThey are adventurous and get into strange places and they do not care for grooves or drudgery at all, in this respect contrasting with the tranquil good contacts.\n\nThey are prone to ignore authority and convention and can be opinionated and rebellious. Sometimes there is a tendency to vainglory and show, but this depends, for its outward manifestation, on Saturn, which may restrain open ostentation and relegate this propensity to the &ldquo;unconscious,&rdquo; whence may arise harmless but foolish dreams of pomp and circumstance.\n\nThe good nature is perceptibly less than with the favorable aspects; it can be selfish and lazy, except when engaged on its own activities. It is less religious but more superstitious and prone to &ldquo;cults.&rdquo; It has not the quiet good breeding of the other aspects.\n\nNor does it appear to be fond of the simple life, though a faulty liver may drive it to temporary abstentions. It may be alternately mean and wasteful, gluttonous and ascetic.\n\nIt seems to gain most from good Saturnine contacts, either to the Sun or Jupiter. The more profuse and precipitate sides of the influence are then held in check, and though there will certainly be trouble of the 9th and 12th house order, this may be less the native&apos;s fault than his misfortune, and may ultimately be surmounted by patience and care. Even faulty Saturnian action, if prominent, may do something to neutralize an afflicted Jupiter, as two poisons may act as antidotes one to another. But if Saturn be not so much afflicted as weak in action, both good and bad, the results may be serious.\n\nThe cultivation of a steady, matter-of-fact attitude may be advised, and a constant determination to seek only what has been earned by honest work. It will be well to distrust all who offer short-cuts to success or attainment, or who paint things in roseate colors, appealing to the gambling and get-rich-quick tendencies. The same applies to those false prophets who promise &ldquo;occult&rdquo; or falsely so-called &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; attainments as the result of &ldquo;stunts&rdquo; The native will often be tempted with specious, unsound things, and the results may be grave, for the 12th house side of Jupiter must not be forgotten&mdash;self-undoing.\n\nThe evil effects will be materially lessened in a generally good map, or if the Sun and Jupiter are otherwise well placed, as by sign and aspect. In any case, a contact of any sort with Jupiter tends to lift the native above the sordid and commonplace&mdash;if only in imagination.\n\nThe effects on the health are chiefly due to imprudence and excess in diet and to a defective action of the liver with consequent toxemia. It tends to gout and obesity. Generally speaking there is need for an active and abstemious life, but the native will probably dislike this prospect and practice restraint too fitfully, if at all.','Charles E.O.

It is not incompatible with considerable worldly success, if other aspects favor, though such success will be won only by sheer hard work and may be retained with difficulty. Often the early life is very hard and the father is of no use to the native; real sympathy between them is rare. He may be hard or unsuccessful or a reprobate. A case in point is that of the ex-Kaiser, whose father ruled only for a short time, died of cancer, and was never intimate with his son. I have a case of a man with Sun square Saturn who as a child was obliged to fetch his father from the public-house regularly&mdash;he grew up a person of staunch moral character, worked extremely hard all his life, and, after severe checks, accumulated a moderate fortune. Here the native&apos;s life was embittered because, though fairly successful, he did not attain his ambitions, which were considerable. In other cases known to me the Sun-Saturn native has achieved a great deal in terms of social status, but not in actual tangible cash. Again, the inhibition is sometimes largely physical (cf. the ex-Kaiser&apos;s withered arm).\n\nWe may distinguish three types : the ambitious but incompetent man who &ldquo;fails,&rdquo; the man who is not ambitious or interested in material affairs, but has to spend his life with them, and the competent and ambitious man who is confronted with obstacles and ill-luck. Often it seems as if this third class does not suffer much discontent from the fact that he has to work hard for comparatively little emolument; in a word, he accepts the Saturnian destiny philosophically and becomes a willing, if not a cheerful, captive of the planet&apos;s regime, finding a sort of satisfaction in the fact that he earns every penny he gets, and sometimes a good deal more. But this will depend upon the general tenor of the map, and especially upon the nature of the ascendant. In a case of the Sun squared by Saturn in Aquarius I have found the native very cheerful in poverty, bearing it in an idealistic spirit.\n\nThe difficulty is always, at heart, one of self-expression. Either proper expression is denied or delayed until it is almost too late to serve its purpose, or else the native tries &ldquo;to force the issue&rdquo; and blunders disastrously. Sometimes the issue is shirked and there is shyness or timidity, which may be hidden behind blatant boastfulness.\n\nChildren being part of our means of self-expression, this contact is evil for them, especially for the eldest, if a male. It may deny boys when these are badly wanted or one of them (usually the eldest) may die, be sickly, or suffer in his fortunes. If there are no boys then it sometimes affects the eldest girl. In a male natus the Sun was trine a debilitated Saturn, and the native had four girls, but no boys, and the eldest underwent a long and serious illness. In a female natus, with a similar trine, there were four girls and then a boy, who was not strong, although all his sisters were robust. In the former of these cases it should be mentioned that the wife had Sun opp. Saturn.\n\nIn women&apos;s maps the husband sometimes exemplifies the affliction by being weak and unfortunate, and there is often much difference of age and social status. In the case just cited the husband was considerably older and (from the wife&apos;s point of view) much immersed in business, while the father had been repeatedly unsuccessful in business.\n\nThe Sun afflicted by Saturn is extremely likely, in a female map, to deny offspring altogether and even to indicate a single condition.\n\nWith respect to health the afflictions cause debility, catarrhal conditions, colds, tubercular tendencies, and maladies of the bones. In regard to accidents it is well known that Saturn inclines to falls, especially if his action falls near the middle of the cardinal signs, the central point of this influence being about the 17th degrees. But by reason of its prudent character the planet is less likely to cause accidents than Mars or Uranus, and as a rule in these cases one or both of the latter intermingle their rays.

However, unless the horoscope contains other mitigating features, the inharmonious contacts are likely to be of an unfortunate nature, even to the extent of catastrophe.\n\nThe self-will of the native is likely to be extreme and the judgment is perverse, refusing, when the self-will is aroused, to take account of the most patent and important facts. Sometimes the afflicted-Uranus person is, as it were, impelled from without to work his own destruction or injury. Vanity, morbid sensitiveness, and wrong-headedness of every kind characterize this class of aspects : if the native is a genius, it will rob him of many of the rewards of genius; if he is capable, he will still, by some foolish act, destroy the fruits of his own work, perhaps after much labor and effort. Even if he is personally amiable, he will still be stubborn, misguided, and fickle. The views, interests, and pursuits are liable to be completely changed, abruptly and often frequently.\n\nIn women it is certainly less dangerous than in men, but it indicates high nervous tension sometimes bordering on the hysterical; and if they are called on to exercise authority the same tendency will be seen to &ldquo;take hold of the wrong end of the stick&rdquo; and to be their own enemy, by some uncalled-for and unnecessary ineptitude. It is not in everyday life that this affliction will generally appear; it will act only occasionally, but often at the most critical times.\n\nIn matters of health it inclines to nervous complaints and also to deep-rooted and obscure ailments.\n\nIt is a common contact in the maps of leaders of &ldquo;occult&rdquo; movements and peculiar cults; but it is an aspect of discord and disruption, and none the less so because such people frequently preach &ldquo;brotherhood&rdquo; before all things, the benefits of this fraternal feeling being as a rule exclusively reserved for those who are prepared to &ldquo;feed out of the hand&rdquo; of the teacher! As a general rule they are difficult people to be on the wrong side of, and in such circumstances can be &ldquo;good haters.&rdquo; In Sun-Uranus there is rarely the humility and self-forgetfulness of the true mystic, although in this respect the square is better than the opposition, and, of course, careful attention must be paid, as always, to the rest of the map.\n\nWhere there is no support from other bodies there can be no doubt that these aspects call for great self-control of the feeling side of the nature, as well as a strenuous effort to maintain mental balance and common-sense. The native cannot be too careful to avoid precipitate action, especially when the feelings are aroused. Above all, the tendency to indulge in inflated fancies of the kind that panders to personal vanity must be avoided, for the dramatic proclivities of the harmonious aspects appear in the inharmonious ones in the guise of self-glorifying impulses, which may have serious results if the rest of the map is of the same kind. There is usually a complete lack of humor in so far as the native is the target thereof.\n\nIt is not a criminal contact and appears to indicate peril to the emotional nature rather than the passional. Further, it may be conceded that it is commonly found in the maps of gifted people, though they may be eccentric and have the other failings here mentioned. Again the ideals may be high and the intentions of the best, nor are they ever cunning or underhanded. They may organize well, and it may be said that often a person with the inharmonious contacts will for a long period behave as wisely and successfully as if he had the harmonious : then he will perhaps suddenly and without reason go off at a tangent and either abandon or gravely injure the construction he has raised.

He seldom realizes his own motives and may in extreme cases even think that he is acting the part of martyr or saint when he is in fact gratifying his self-approbation. There is a craving for something great, wonderful, and out of the ordinary, but there is not the ability or the wisdom to pursue what is genuinely possessed of these attributes, and those who bait the hook with specious promises can usually fish for the native successfully. If the native is ambitious in a worldly way, he can be caught by the get-rich-quick shark; if his ambitions are of a pseudo-spiritual kind, he may fall a victim to &ldquo;cultism.&rdquo; He may be betrayed when his emotions have been stirred, by actual dope or drink, or by plausible rhetoric. Those who seek &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; powers, as they are called, who wish to &ldquo;get into touch with the Masters&rdquo; by stunt-exercises, seek to become &ldquo;great healers,&rdquo; and otherwise succumb to the delusive claptrap that is now heard on all sides for the edification of well-intentioned but misguided people-these are commonly found to have Sun-Neptune afflictions.\n\nSpiritists commonly have these configurations, and they occur also in the horoscopes of Christian Scientists, vegetarians, conscientious objectors, and others, who frequently are actuated by the noblest motives, but, in the case of those with the afflictions, either carry their ideals to injudicious extremes or suffer through the opposition of others or the excesses of their associates, with no apparent fault on their own part.\n\nSometimes extreme sensitiveness to suffering, and resultant painful experiences, characterize these people.\n\nThe tendency of Neptune to produce scandal is often seen; sometimes the native is to blame, sometimes apparently not. Often the whole affair is involved in mystery, and no one seems to know the truth about it.\n\nAgain, while some Sun-Neptunian people are muddlers, others are very careful and painstaking, but either have confused conditions thrust upon them by force of circumstance, or at some point in their lives their prudence seems strangely to desert them, and a long train of disorder has to be worked out.\n\nSympathy, kindliness, and love of animals are very pronounced. They are nearly always &ldquo;good sorts.&rdquo; Excess of emotion is their peril; their desire-nature seems very easily stimulated and attracted, and they seem then to lack patience and to seek short cuts to their goals, inclining to scamp details and blind themselves to existing obstacles, facts, and conditions. The same trait seems to make them sometimes oblivious to the laws of conventional morality and straight-forwardness, not perhaps so often deliberately as by reason of a seeming &ldquo;blind spot.&rdquo;\n\nNeptune often causes people to be officious and overfond of proffering unasked advice and (in popular parlance) of preaching sermons : it does often literally produce preachers.\n\nThe inharmonious aspects are evil for the father, who is sometimes domineering and selfish, or may be unfortunate, irresponsible in the Neptunian way, or may die young.\n\nIt causes worry through the children.\n\nWomen with this contact may be advised to be especially careful in respect of their male associates, as they are nearly certain to meet morally instable characters, and, very often, men who are the reverse of what they seem. Drink is a common danger.\n\nIn all practical affairs the native has to guard constantly against deception and will be well advised to avoid all Neptunian interests or occupations, such as those connected with shipping, canals, water-supply, breweries, narcotics, lotteries, tobacco interests, substitute and artificial articles (e.g. artificial silk), marine cables, fishing, rubber, and sleep (e.g. bedding). The various pursuits that are related to the so-called astral plane should be scrupulously avoided, or investigated only in a strictly scientific and detached spirit. He cannot be too particular to keep his affairs in order and avoid everything that is not absolutely above-board and free from the possibility of misconstruction. Further, it is well to keep an eye open for all persons who may approach the native in connection with Neptune things, or who may by their habits or appearance give him reason to suspect Neptunian characteristics, promising something for nothing, or much for little. Motives and characters must be rigidly scrutinized.\n\nSobriety, in the widest sense, is needed to enable one to steer through the rocks and currents of this contact.

Sometimes the affections are strangely and (possibly) tragically bestowed; there is an element of perversity and great determination, which may be directed wisely or unwisely, but very rarely follows any conventional or usual course. The interests are nearly always strange, and both mind and feelings differ from those of ordinary humanity, often giving rise to conditions with which it is exceedingly difficult for another to deal, because the native is deaf to reason and seems unable to help himself, there being a veritable paralysis of the judgment. Perhaps it is most perilous in Fire, and least so in Air, but I have known strange people with this aspect even in the latter element&mdash;they are, however, less excitable than those having it in Fire, their vagaries being more often intellectual.

In the more ordinary types we find chiefly a desire to do comparatively usual things in an unusual manner or on a grandiose scale. In more exceptional horoscopes the desire takes all sorts of strange forms.\n\nHere the restless, insatiate character of the combination is much to the front. It is a kind, sympathetic, warm-hearted influence (though less so in such a sign as Gemini) and often has much to do with the sadder and more stricken part of humanity. There is also, by reason of the great sensitiveness, a marked tendency to withdraw into seclusion and live a retired and cloistered life. My impression is, that it is a very dissatisfied contact, but this unhappiness is often concealed, and is only to be detected by one who is aware of the forms in which such a condition betrays itself. Thus we may have gloomy moods, sarcasm, sneers at others, temper, resentment of supposed ill-usage, cynicism, extravagant display&mdash;all attempts to appease an inner hunger.

If the map is strong the native develops and improves his office and maintains the tradition with success and dignity, but even when the two bodies are technically in good aspect, other flaws in the horoscope may lead to downfall and the characteristics of the inharmonious contacts.\n\nGenerally this combination preserves the health by influencing the native to be prudent and regular in habits, and it is particularly good in old age. But it does not confer robust health.','Charles E.O. Carter',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Sometimes the effects of the contacts are apparently slight, and the same is often true, I believe, of directions between the same bodies. It seems that the good aspects favor the rigid performance of duty and make the native capable of enduring and sacrificing much for anything that he conceives as being an obligation or an ideal. He will be of the type that cannot be argued with; he seems to get his inspirations and beliefs from another world, or, as is sometimes said, intuitively&mdash;a word often used to indicate feelings that cannot be justified rationally and are not to be submitted to rational analysis.

In the more ordinary types we find chiefly a desire to do comparatively usual things in an unusual manner or on a grandiose scale. In more exceptional horoscopes the desire takes all sorts of strange forms.\n\nThe contacts are undoubtedly beneficial in a worldly sense, tending to bestow wealth and ease, and very often there are more of the good things of life than the native seems to merit; he may benefit considerably by others&apos; brains and toil and may be a conscious or unconscious parasite.\n\nIt is specially good for the numerous Neptunian features of modern business, such as hire-purchase.\n\nIn some cases there is much spiritual ambition, inclining, if the rest of the map shows afflictions, to such unbalance as we find in Joseph Smith the Mormon, Wilhelm II of Germany, Gandhi, and Archbishop Laud (who was a very superstitious man).\n\nIt has a mediumistic and spiritist side, for Neptune has particularly intimate relations with the so-called &ldquo;astral plane&rdquo;; but this tendency has been exaggerated, and is more commonly found under other aspects to Neptune.\n\nIt is a rather unsatisfying configuration, for there is no boundary to the aspirations of Neptune, and we often find an overweening desire to push further and further ahead, without due acceptance of the limitations which mundane conditions necessarily impose upon all of us.','Charles E.O.

There is very often a combative tendency and a sharp tongue&mdash;Raphael speaks of &ldquo;backbiting, lying, and slandering,&rdquo; which is probably rather excessive. But there is a noticeable proclivity for gossip, and sometimes expressions are used in the wrong manner or at the wrong time, giving rise to misunderstandings and offence. It is a very independent influence, and occurs often in the maps of reformers, especially of those who attack the habits of the people : it is prone to be sensitive and even withdrawn. Sometimes the native may live before the public, but reside figuratively speaking on a pedestal, or, on the other hand, he may seek physical seclusion.\n\nIt does not incline to popularity, or the popularity may be fitful; it is bad for all 3rd house matters, such as publications; and it induces criticism, especially in the press. On the other hand, the native may have many perfervid followers but he may be equally disliked by other sections : it brings one into the arena and storms are apt to gather round the native&apos;s head. Usually the abilities are sufficient to enable him to hold his own.\n\nIn men&apos;s maps it tends to slanderous attacks or criticisms in regard to women : for example, the imprisonment of W. T. Stead in consequence of the &ldquo;Maiden Tribute&rdquo; affair. (Venus also square Neptune.) In neither sex is it good for marriage, although it is in itself a general rather than a specific influence; and it should not be regarded as likely to cause any definite condition unless aspects of a more decisive character intervene. I have known cases in which men have been persistently attacked on the score of their morals when this aspect has been combined with some such indication as Venus in affliction with Neptune.\n\nThese contacts seem to make the people born with them very sympathetic, and often actively so; there are many examples where they have been the champions of the weak. They are in fact very sensitive to any attacks upon their proteges or friends. It is one of the loyalist of aspects, and will always fly to arms on behalf of those it likes, demanding that strangers should treat its allies much more considerately than it is often prepared to do itself. It is often a genuine patriot and gets much misunderstood for its pains (Lord Roberts); on the other hand, it may champion its country&apos;s enemies, and get abused yet more (W. T. Stead &ldquo;Shall I slay my brother Boer?&rdquo;)\n\nIn many respects this conformation seems to me to resemble what is commonly ascribed to Uranus.

This austere, self-abnegating type certainly occurs when other more severe influences are also at work. The sphere of the Moon and Venus is a homely and usual one, and aspiring persons sometimes spurn it in the desire to live a larger life, as is recorded of Gautama, and as is also exemplified in the saying of Jesus, &ldquo;Who is my Mother, or my brethren?&rdquo;\n\nIn more common cases there is simply ordinary incompatibility between husband and wife, or, if there be affection of a kind, nevertheless the woman&apos;s influence is an unfortunate one. In other cases marriage does not take place owing to some obstacle. It is probable that this hindrance is usually either a rival (Libra) or a matter of money (Taurus), unless it is due to the signs and houses occupied.\n\nNor is the influence by any means limited to the married state. It is unfortunate for all 7th house matters, and the native is likely to suffer through associates of all kinds that come under this house. It is also bad for money, which will perhaps be rejected together with other worldly things, or may be lost through 7th house affairs&mdash;I believe, however, that a voluntary poverty is more common so far as this contact is concerned, and that where the native actually desires wealth the aspects are no serious obstacle.\n\nSometimes there is a certain amount of weakness and shyness and a gentleness or gentility that may appear effeminate; sometimes, to hide this, the native is moody or rough. The affections are very sincere and active.

These two subtypes are very different, the one being essentially vigorous; the other profound. But in both cases there tends to be a practical outlook&mdash;it does not incline to a purely intellectual point of view, though a large amount of air in the horoscope may introduce this.\n\nThe most usual effect of these aspects in the horoscopes of &ldquo;nice&rdquo; people is ill-health&mdash;it is rarer to find accidents under the Luni-Martian aspects than it is under those in which the Sun is implicated. Often the health is not robust, there are many illnesses of greater or less severity, and life is not likely to run its full measure, though one may point to such a case as that of Lord Balfour, who after a very delicate infancy lived to an advanced age. Alan Leo is a case wherein, after a healthy life, death came suddenly and unexpectedly.\n\nIn another class we find the combative and pugnacious side of the contacts in full play, as for example in the case of Georges Clemenceau, Gandhi, and Ruskin.\n\nThe tendency to deep thought is common in the bad contacts, but the native is apt to be influenced too much by his emotions, and there is a rebellious and intolerant element which refuses to see any good in its opponents.\n\nA more disagreeable type is the self-indulgent prodigal, with tendencies to drink and promiscuity. There seems always to be a certain degree of kindheartedness, of a rough and selfish kind&mdash;the sort that is kind with other people&apos;s money, or when no personal sacrifice is involved. Otherwise this contact may go with a pretty considerable blackguard, the native having little self-respect, self-control, or refinement. Thus we have the cases of &ldquo;Defalcating Bank Clerk&rdquo;, &ldquo;Drunkard,&rdquo; &ldquo;Adventuress,&rdquo; &ldquo;Young Prodigal,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Opium and Alcohol.&rdquo;\n\nSometimes there is obstinacy and self-will, and probably in all examples there is a liability to hot temper or sullenness, but it is certain that in many cases this is not very prominent.\n\nThe effects of this influence on the vocation are to incline the native very strongly to seek his own career and make himself independent of others. It points to one who strikes out his own course, and it is probable that in some of the criminal examples this course of life was adopted in order to avoid drudgery, routine, and control by others.\n\nIt is unfavorable for the parents, either or both of whom may die young or suffer misfortunes which will affect the whole family. Thus Charles II suffered prolonged exile after his father&apos;s beheading, and George IV&apos;s father was insane for many years. Frederick the Great of Prussia underwent great cruelties at the hands of his father. Sometimes this influence seems only to extend so far as to make the parent Martian in character or occupation, and sometimes the native is brought into danger by the example of the father, or when following him. It generally denotes that the family history is not altogether a happy or prosperous one.\n\nIt is distinctly unfavorable for marriage in the case of males. The wife may be an invalid, meet with accidents, or be of a domineering disposition; or there may be mutual incompatibility.\n\nIn the case of women, I think it is unfavorable because of the independence which it signifies; if there is marriage, then I believe that the husband chosen will usually be of the meeker kind, for this contact is intolerant of restraint.','Charles E.O.

But the disposition is much more restless and sometimes even combative, while in more &ldquo;stagnant&rdquo; maps, containing more Venus than Mars influence, there may be a lazy and self-indulgent tendency. It may be superstitious, and is sometimes an extremist either for or against religion. In the same way, there is usually misfortune in regard to foreign countries or foreigners, and these contacts occur often in the maps of statesmen or soldiers who have been in conflict with foreign powers. The native either dislikes religion or quarrels about it.\n\nIn his attitude to money and business affairs the native is not as a rule balanced. Sometimes there is avarice, sometimes indifference and carelessness. It is more often imprudent than extravagant, in my experience, this latter vice being common when Mars is in affliction with Jupiter. In the same way it is at times rebellious and given to attacks upon conventionality; but here also it is necessary that Mars should take a hand if there is to be anything violent. For the Moon and Jupiter are both too kindly and gentle in character to occasion by themselves any very serious outbreaks. Rather it may be said that, when other elements in a map supply this destructive energy, the afflictions of Moon-Jupiter give direction to it.\n\nIt is less happy than the good aspects, and it may cause the native to &ldquo;let things slide&rdquo; to his or her detriment. But almost any contact of Jupiter tends to bring the native to some extent into touch with ease, comfort, and a certain amount of success, and the squares and oppositions of the Moon and Jupiter are often found in the maps of successful people. The extent of its power to do harm depends greatly upon Saturn, for if that planet be strong it will control its too optimistic and easy-going tendencies.\n\nIn regard to health it affects the liver adversely, particularly if the native be of a slothful habit or given to over-eating.

Depression and discontent are common.\n\nWith depression there is often a lack of real self-reliance and the native may be a prey to fear and foreboding, and a feeling of general inadequacy in respect of his obligations and duties. He is apt sometimes to rely on the material supports of life rather than on character.\n\nShyness is common.\n\nThe entire feminine side of the nature is limited by this contact, and unless other aspects come to the assistance of the Moon, much unhappiness and emotional inhibition may occur. Even the good aspects of the Moon and Saturn sometimes tend to dourness and rigidity, and a dislike of, or inability to partake in, pleasures, particularly if Venus be weak.\n\nOn the circumstantial side, which will be the more evident in many cases, there is a likelihood of hardship particularly in early and in late life. The native may easily be misunderstood, and have to endure harshness, severity, and lack of emotional satisfaction.\n\nThe relations with the mother are rarely happy; she may be unfortunate, or may die young, be unhealthy, or be a burden to the native; or she may be dominating and stern in her attitude. The home is seldom imbued with a genial atmosphere such as a child needs.\n\nIn marriage it tends to unions between persons of diverse ages; sometimes there are social differences and the parents either prevent marriage or urge unsatisfactory alliances based on Saturnian considerations of duty, advantage, and so forth.

In such cases the bad effects often appear to be largely externalized, perhaps in health and nervous tension, perhaps in sorrow or catastrophe through friendships and alliances. It appears that the possession of these aspects is a direct admonition to follow one&apos;s own path and to be extremely chary of accepting advice or of leaning on others.\n\nThey appear to generate great activity, mental and physical, but I have not always noted in the bad aspects the inflexibility that is found with the good ones.

Much must, as always, depend on other parts of the map, but as a general rule it is a scandal-engendering influence. It also often causes the wife to be an invalid, a recluse, or a nag. Neptune has high ideals, and under affliction is prone to apply them mercilessly, sometimes to itself, sometimes to others, perhaps both to itself and to others. Discontent and complaints ensue. An inability to rest satisfied with anything short of perfection is a common and a tormenting condition.\n\nIn affairs there is a tendency to intrigue, and to seek short-cuts and get-rich-quick methods. There is sometimes a subtle interior laziness, which shuns definite matter-of-fact views, and seeks to meander in fantasy. A legitimate outlet for these romantic tendencies is very much to be desired.\n\nIn women there is a high emotional tension with various forms of manifestation. From a moral point of view they run from the deceptive and untruthful to those who are unreliable owing to the instable character of their feelings. There is also a distinct liability to be deceived by others and to suffer various forms of disillusion. Neptunian traits often appear in the husband even with the lunar affliction, and similarly with the father. This, I know, is quite contrary to accepted teachings, in which the Moon is always referred to the mother, but the evidence is pretty clear. Thus, running down my list of six female cases with Moon in bad aspect to Neptune, I find : Two cases where the father was a minister of religion, two where he was an artist, and two where he was a muddler!\n\nIn the case of men it seems that one or other of the parents is often of a harsh&mdash;sometimes a rigid disciplinarian or Puritanic-type. This is clearly shown in the case of King Edward VII. In his case Moon is square Saturn as well as sesquiquadrate Neptune, but I have noticed it in other cases wherein the Moon was afflicted only by Neptune.\n\nI have known instances wherein the square seems to have denoted a parasitical tendency, the native being of an easy-going, put-off-the-evil-day type, but as a rule receiving help in his difficulties from others.\n\nThe tendency to resort to spiritualistic practices is common under these configurations; and this I attribute to the inborn desire of the Neptunian to rise to something above and beyond earthly interests. Moreover, the &ldquo;messages&rdquo; delivered by mediums are often of a comforting and optimistic character, and this is helpful to the anxious frame of mind that Moon-Neptune afflictions are apt to generate. Further, Neptune, through the 12th house, has affinity with death and the dead, and these aspects seem sometimes to cause the native to be obsessed by thoughts of the hereafter. These proclivities seem commoner in women than in men, whose activities depend on solar rather than lunar configurations. I know a case of a couple both of whom have Moon square Neptune in almost identical degrees&mdash;Pisces to Gemini&mdash;and the spiritist interests are very strong in the wife, but the husband is hardly affected except through her.','Charles E.O.

It seems to lessen the number of children and sometimes cause them to be a heavy responsibility.\n\nIt is favorable for business life and for practical work that calls for care and prudence rather than energy or originality&mdash;which is often defective. It is good for work in connection with houses or land, and any sort of caretaking or management where conscientious work is called for, but it is not so good where affection is required, as in care for the young.\n\nIt is distinctly good for worldly success, or, perhaps one should rather say, for the retention and proper use of success, if the rest of the map permits of its attainment. Sometimes rank and position result from family connections or are inherited&mdash;there is often a sort of relation between family and position, or the native assumes a place as a successor to someone else, but does not create it. For example, a professor who occupies a seat that has been vacated by his predecessor, a minister of state, president of a society, or editor of an established paper. Thus the position is usually one of a successive line, and the native inherits some kind of tradition. If the map is strong the native develops and improves his office and maintains the tradition with success and dignity, but even when the two bodies are technically in good aspect, other flaws in the horoscope may lead to downfall and the characteristics of the inharmonious contacts.\n\nGenerally this combination preserves the health by influencing the native to be prudent and regular in habits, and it is particularly good in old age. But it does not confer robust health.','Charles E.O. Carter',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Sometimes the effects of the contacts are apparently slight, and the same is often true, I believe, of directions between the same bodies. It seems that the good aspects favor the rigid performance of duty and make the native capable of enduring and sacrificing much for anything that he conceives as being an obligation or an ideal. He will be of the type that cannot be argued with; he seems to get his inspirations and beliefs from another world, or, as is sometimes said, intuitively&mdash;a word often used to indicate feelings that cannot be justified rationally and are not to be submitted to rational analysis.

There is very often a combative tendency and a sharp tongue&mdash;Raphael speaks of &ldquo;backbiting, lying, and slandering,&rdquo; which is probably rather excessive. But there is a noticeable proclivity for gossip, and sometimes expressions are used in the wrong manner or at the wrong time, giving rise to misunderstandings and offence. It is a very independent influence, and occurs often in the maps of reformers, especially of those who attack the habits of the people : it is prone to be sensitive and even withdrawn. Sometimes the native may live before the public, but reside figuratively speaking on a pedestal, or, on the other hand, he may seek physical seclusion.\n\nIt does not incline to popularity, or the popularity may be fitful; it is bad for all 3rd house matters, such as publications; and it induces criticism, especially in the press. On the other hand, the native may have many perfervid followers but he may be equally disliked by other sections : it brings one into the arena and storms are apt to gather round the native&apos;s head. Usually the abilities are sufficient to enable him to hold his own.\n\nIn men&apos;s maps it tends to slanderous attacks or criticisms in regard to women : for example, the imprisonment of W. T. Stead in consequence of the &ldquo;Maiden Tribute&rdquo; affair. (Venus also square Neptune.) In neither sex is it good for marriage, although it is in itself a general rather than a specific influence; and it should not be regarded as likely to cause any definite condition unless aspects of a more decisive character intervene. I have known cases in which men have been persistently attacked on the score of their morals when this aspect has been combined with some such indication as Venus in affliction with Neptune.\n\nThese contacts seem to make the people born with them very sympathetic, and often actively so; there are many examples where they have been the champions of the weak. They are in fact very sensitive to any attacks upon their proteges or friends. It is one of the loyalist of aspects, and will always fly to arms on behalf of those it likes, demanding that strangers should treat its allies much more considerately than it is often prepared to do itself. It is often a genuine patriot and gets much misunderstood for its pains (Lord Roberts); on the other hand, it may champion its country&apos;s enemies, and get abused yet more (W. T. Stead &ldquo;Shall I slay my brother Boer?&rdquo;)\n\nIn many respects this conformation seems to me to resemble what is commonly ascribed to Uranus.

This austere, self-abnegating type certainly occurs when other more severe influences are also at work. The sphere of the Moon and Venus is a homely and usual one, and aspiring persons sometimes spurn it in the desire to live a larger life, as is recorded of Gautama, and as is also exemplified in the saying of Jesus, &ldquo;Who is my Mother, or my brethren?&rdquo;\n\nIn more common cases there is simply ordinary incompatibility between husband and wife, or, if there be affection of a kind, nevertheless the woman&apos;s influence is an unfortunate one. In other cases marriage does not take place owing to some obstacle. It is probable that this hindrance is usually either a rival (Libra) or a matter of money (Taurus), unless it is due to the signs and houses occupied.\n\nNor is the influence by any means limited to the married state. It is unfortunate for all 7th house matters, and the native is likely to suffer through associates of all kinds that come under this house. It is also bad for money, which will perhaps be rejected together with other worldly things, or may be lost through 7th house affairs&mdash;I believe, however, that a voluntary poverty is more common so far as this contact is concerned, and that where the native actually desires wealth the aspects are no serious obstacle.\n\nSometimes there is a certain amount of weakness and shyness and a gentleness or gentility that may appear effeminate; sometimes, to hide this, the native is moody or rough.

These two subtypes are very different, the one being essentially vigorous; the other profound. But in both cases there tends to be a practical outlook&mdash;it does not incline to a purely intellectual point of view, though a large amount of air in the horoscope may introduce this.\n\nThe most usual effect of these aspects in the horoscopes of &ldquo;nice&rdquo; people is ill-health&mdash;it is rarer to find accidents under the Luni-Martian aspects than it is under those in which the Sun is implicated. Often the health is not robust, there are many illnesses of greater or less severity, and life is not likely to run its full measure, though one may point to such a case as that of Lord Balfour, who after a very delicate infancy lived to an advanced age. Alan Leo is a case wherein, after a healthy life, death came suddenly and unexpectedly.\n\nIn another class we find the combative and pugnacious side of the contacts in full play, as for example in the case of Georges Clemenceau, Gandhi, and Ruskin.\n\nThe tendency to deep thought is common in the bad contacts, but the native is apt to be influenced too much by his emotions, and there is a rebellious and intolerant element which refuses to see any good in its opponents.\n\nA more disagreeable type is the self-indulgent prodigal, with tendencies to drink and promiscuity. There seems always to be a certain degree of kindheartedness, of a rough and selfish kind&mdash;the sort that is kind with other people&apos;s money, or when no personal sacrifice is involved. Otherwise this contact may go with a pretty considerable blackguard, the native having little self-respect, self-control, or refinement. Thus we have the cases of &ldquo;Defalcating Bank Clerk&rdquo;, &ldquo;Drunkard,&rdquo; &ldquo;Adventuress,&rdquo; &ldquo;Young Prodigal,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Opium and Alcohol.&rdquo;\n\nSometimes there is obstinacy and self-will, and probably in all examples there is a liability to hot temper or sullenness, but it is certain that in many cases this is not very prominent.\n\nThe effects of this influence on the vocation are to incline the native very strongly to seek his own career and make himself independent of others. It points to one who strikes out his own course, and it is probable that in some of the criminal examples this course of life was adopted in order to avoid drudgery, routine, and control by others.\n\nIt is unfavorable for the parents, either or both of whom may die young or suffer misfortunes which will affect the whole family. Thus Charles II suffered prolonged exile after his father&apos;s beheading, and George IV&apos;s father was insane for many years. Frederick the Great of Prussia underwent great cruelties at the hands of his father. Sometimes this influence seems only to extend so far as to make the parent Martian in character or occupation, and sometimes the native is brought into danger by the example of the father, or when following him. It generally denotes that the family history is not altogether a happy or prosperous one.\n\nIt is distinctly unfavorable for marriage in the case of males. The wife may be an invalid, meet with accidents, or be of a domineering disposition; or there may be mutual incompatibility.\n\nIn the case of women, I think it is unfavorable because of the independence which it signifies; if there is marriage, then I believe that the husband chosen will usually be of the meeker kind, for this contact is intolerant of restraint.','Charles E.O.

But the disposition is much more restless and sometimes even combative, while in more &ldquo;stagnant&rdquo; maps, containing more Venus than Mars influence, there may be a lazy and self-indulgent tendency. It may be superstitious, and is sometimes an extremist either for or against religion. In the same way, there is usually misfortune in regard to foreign countries or foreigners, and these contacts occur often in the maps of statesmen or soldiers who have been in conflict with foreign powers. The native either dislikes religion or quarrels about it.\n\nIn his attitude to money and business affairs the native is not as a rule balanced. Sometimes there is avarice, sometimes indifference and carelessness. It is more often imprudent than extravagant, in my experience, this latter vice being common when Mars is in affliction with Jupiter. In the same way it is at times rebellious and given to attacks upon conventionality; but here also it is necessary that Mars should take a hand if there is to be anything violent. For the Moon and Jupiter are both too kindly and gentle in character to occasion by themselves any very serious outbreaks. Rather it may be said that, when other elements in a map supply this destructive energy, the afflictions of Moon-Jupiter give direction to it.\n\nIt is less happy than the good aspects, and it may cause the native to &ldquo;let things slide&rdquo; to his or her detriment. But almost any contact of Jupiter tends to bring the native to some extent into touch with ease, comfort, and a certain amount of success, and the squares and oppositions of the Moon and Jupiter are often found in the maps of successful people. The extent of its power to do harm depends greatly upon Saturn, for if that planet be strong it will control its too optimistic and easy-going tendencies.\n\nIn regard to health it affects the liver adversely, particularly if the native be of a slothful habit or given to over-eating.

Depression and discontent are common.\n\nWith depression there is often a lack of real self-reliance and the native may be a prey to fear and foreboding, and a feeling of general inadequacy in respect of his obligations and duties.

The native may easily be misunderstood, and have to endure harshness, severity, and lack of emotional satisfaction.\n\nThe relations with the mother are rarely happy; she may be unfortunate, or may die young, be unhealthy, or be a burden to the native; or she may be dominating and stern in her attitude.

Much must, as always, depend on other parts of the map, but as a general rule it is a scandal-engendering influence. It also often causes the wife to be an invalid, a recluse, or a nag. Neptune has high ideals, and under affliction is prone to apply them mercilessly, sometimes to itself, sometimes to others, perhaps both to itself and to others. Discontent and complaints ensue. An inability to rest satisfied with anything short of perfection is a common and a tormenting condition.\n\nIn affairs there is a tendency to intrigue, and to seek short-cuts and get-rich-quick methods. There is sometimes a subtle interior laziness, which shuns definite matter-of-fact views, and seeks to meander in fantasy. A legitimate outlet for these romantic tendencies is very much to be desired.\n\nIn women there is a high emotional tension with various forms of manifestation. From a moral point of view they run from the deceptive and untruthful to those who are unreliable owing to the instable character of their feelings. There is also a distinct liability to be deceived by others and to suffer various forms of disillusion. Neptunian traits often appear in the husband even with the lunar affliction, and similarly with the father. This, I know, is quite contrary to accepted teachings, in which the Moon is always referred to the mother, but the evidence is pretty clear. Thus, running down my list of six female cases with Moon in bad aspect to Neptune, I find : Two cases where the father was a minister of religion, two where he was an artist, and two where he was a muddler!\n\nIn the case of men it seems that one or other of the parents is often of a harsh&mdash;sometimes a rigid disciplinarian or Puritanic-type. This is clearly shown in the case of King Edward VII. In his case Moon is square Saturn as well as sesquiquadrate Neptune, but I have noticed it in other cases wherein the Moon was afflicted only by Neptune.\n\nI have known instances wherein the square seems to have denoted a parasitical tendency, the native being of an easy-going, put-off-the-evil-day type, but as a rule receiving help in his difficulties from others.\n\nThe tendency to resort to spiritualistic practices is common under these configurations; and this I attribute to the inborn desire of the Neptunian to rise to something above and beyond earthly interests. Moreover, the &ldquo;messages&rdquo; delivered by mediums are often of a comforting and optimistic character, and this is helpful to the anxious frame of mind that Moon-Neptune afflictions are apt to generate. Further, Neptune, through the 12th house, has affinity with death and the dead, and these aspects seem sometimes to cause the native to be obsessed by thoughts of the hereafter. These proclivities seem commoner in women than in men, whose activities depend on solar rather than lunar configurations. I know a case of a couple both of whom have Moon square Neptune in almost identical degrees&mdash;Pisces to Gemini&mdash;and the spiritist interests are very strong in the wife, but the husband is hardly affected except through her.','Charles E.O.

Sometimes there is marked ambition, but the native is prepared to labor for his results.\n\nThe limiting effects of Saturn may be seen in a too practical and commonplace tendency; one may find such a type as the &ldquo;practical housewife&rdquo; under this influence, and it may indicate something of a martinet.\n\nThere is nearly always a serious outlook, the one exception which has come to my notice being that of the irresponsible Charles II, in whose life the founding of the Royal Society may be considered as the fruits, from the national point of view, of this combination (in Air).\n\nGenerally speaking the mind is exceedingly methodical; all problems are, as it were, carefully sorted and arranged in their component parts, and are studied and mastered in detail.

There is kindness and gentleness, and a dislike of rough conditions and harsh conduct, for Neptune sensitizes all that it contacts. Hence the nervous system is delicate and the senses are able to appreciate the rarer shades of color, sound, touch, and meaning. Often there is a gift of whimsical and fanciful writing, and the sense of humor is usually well developed.\n\nIt is an influence which is very helpful to a journalist, for the delicacy of touch enables the native to &ldquo;feel the pulse of the public&rdquo; very successfully.

In regard to the latter, even bad aspects are better than none.\n\nThe general effect of the combination is to increase the mental energies, sometimes to the extent of causing danger of mental or nervous breakdown. With their exercise much of the Martian influence is mixed, so that the native is either combative, fault-finding, and opinionated himself, or he encounters the opposition of others who possess that character. It must be agreed that usually the former condition is the nearer to actuality, for aspects of Mercury seldom fail to affect the native&apos;s own disposition.\n\nIf the map as a whole is benevolent, then the native will attack what he conceives to be abuses, but if it is of a malevolent type, then he will assail others either out of greed or ill-nature.

Mercury loses some of its sharpness and acuteness. There may be a propensity to forget names and words sometimes in the midst of conversation, and absent-mindedness is frequent. There may be a woolgathering tendency. The mind may be skeptical in religious matters, or, on the other hand, there may be superstition; that not uncommon person, the superstitious infidel, seems to come under these configurations. It is not a combination that will give balance in religious thought or practice, and although it is often kind and generous, nevertheless here too its action is often eccentric. Reason and faith are commonly in conflict. It is often found in maps of those who have &ldquo;religious difficulties.&rdquo;\n\nIt inclines to carelessness and imprudence, especially in small things; the native tends to exaggerate and scorns the dull formality of facts. Judgment is poor and the native is not likely to give good advice, especially in matters coming under either planet. He is a poor prophet, and astrologers with these afflictions are not likely to win credit for themselves or their art so far as predictive work is concerned.\n\nSometimes there is considerable self-assurance and conceit, even to the extent of intolerable self-opiniation and self-sufficiency. But under quick cross-examination this bluff is easily dispelled, for the native can rarely collect his mental resources rapidly and is readily flustered; he cannot, as it were, maneuver under fire. In fact, he will do well to learn to refuse to be hurried into answering questions, and to cultivate the faculty of forming cool, precise opinions.\n\nIt is generally an indiscreet contact, apt to &ldquo;let the cat out of the bag&rdquo; in an embarrassing manner.\n\nIn ordinary life this combination usually denotes many little troubles, but if the native should occupy himself with matters ruled by the two planets he may find them a constant and possibly serious danger, owing to the deception, duplicity, and muddle that they may cause. Thus, in any matter coming under banking, insurance, any kind of guaranteeing or going surety, sports, and hunting, publishing and travelling their influence is often strong. It often denotes losses through the mistakes or dishonesty of employees or subordinates of some sort, and sometimes through imprudent optimism on the native&apos;s own part. There is a danger of loss through the bankruptcy of others. With other more serious afflictions it may combine to indicate danger of fraud, libel, slander, and similar Mercurial attacks on one&apos;s money and reputation.\n\nIt tends to injure the health through the liver, and there is often a direct poisoning of the nervous system in consequence.\n\nThe artistic and literary proclivities of the good aspects are equally present with the bad, and sometimes there is more activity and ambition with the latter. The religious or philosophic motif is often present, and such a poem as Tennyson&apos;s &ast;In Memoriam&ast; may, as regards its general tenor, be considered a good exemplification of this aspect.\n\nThere is often a distinct tendency to neglect worldly matters for art, religion, literature, or some cognate occupation.','Charles E.O.

But afflictions between Saturn and Mercury (sometimes Saturn and the Moon) are very common in the nativities of tyrants and of narrow-minded and narrow-sympathied persons generally, who see only one rule and like to enforce it rigidly and universally, being prepared to sacrifice everything to law and order. Even if the nature is benevolent there is sometimes a liking for disciplining people : for example, the Prince Consort inflicted a very austere upbringing on King Edward VII, and religious people with this aspect join &ldquo;Orders&rdquo; with strict methods, the very word &ldquo;order&rdquo; touching a responsive chord in their hearts.\n\nIn politics it inclines of course to Conservatism, but it is only sometimes a stupid conservatism, for, although afflictions of Saturn may produce stupid people, they often point to shrewdness and hardheadedness, which knows when to give way.\n\nAt times the position betokens uncongenial responsibilities, and it can lead to ultimate failure and downfall, with waning or eclipsed popularity.

The square of Mercury and Neptune occurs in the maps of both the nuns given in &ast;1,001 Nativities&ast;.

Good aspects show benefit from one&apos;s children; for instance, Gladstone, whose good name has been vigorously upheld by his son, had them in sextile; James I, whose son (and mother) were beheaded, had them in square; Sir Harry Lauder (conjunction) lost his only son.

Sometimes, though less often, he is unpractical, a failure, and a financial burden to his family. Sometimes his early death is denoted, and step-parents may occur.

The great gift of the combination seems to be grace of expression, although this may be expressed in some forms only. As a rule the grace is verbal, but sometimes it would be more true to say that there is an attractive grace of demeanor. I have occasionally noticed this even in persons with Venus and Jupiter in bad aspect, provided they are in congenial signs. A case like that of Tennyson shows that the grace of expression may be expressed only through writing, for he was often gruff in his behavior. Sometimes there are oratorical abilities.\n\nOften the feelings are capricious and restless, so that connubial happiness does not always accompany this contact, nor is the native always happy in disposition : its chief influence seems certainly to be in the direction of art and literature.\n\nIt promotes popularity and affection, so benefiting anyone who has to do with the public, especially in the way of amusing or pleasing them. It is less good for those who must correct or instruct.\n\nThe effects of this combination on the health are often considerable, and it seems often to promote longevity, perhaps because the influence of Venus tempers and moderates the Jovian tendency towards excess and hazardous conduct.','Charles E.O.

For example, in my cases of suicide there is exactly the same number of the one class as of the other. It would seem that some bodies are of a naturally antagonistic character, so that even the harmony of a trine or sextile cannot altogether weld their influences into harmony. Naturally this failure of the good aspects to produce good is the more noticeable when either Venus or Saturn is otherwise weak by sign or aspect. In some fifty cases that I have tabulated it is extremely hard to differentiate the good from the bad aspects by a mere reference to the facts of the life and character of each native : some of the unhappiest have had the former, and vice versa.\n\nVenus is naturally a light-spirited influence, and any contact of Saturn seems to quench this : &ldquo;chill as a dull face frowning on a song.&rdquo; Saturn is stern reality forcing itself upon our happy moments that are born of Venus.\n\nBut with the harmonious aspects it is probable that not only are the actual effects alleviated, even if we cannot measure this mitigation, but there is the possibility of considerable spiritual beauty, born of material hardship and the absence of the ordinary pleasures of life. Indeed these are often willingly rejected for the sake of some ideal. The burden is born, but it is carried gladly. Saturn is irradiated by Venus, and the &ldquo;spiritual marriage&rdquo; may be consummated.\n\nIn all cases the affections are likely to be very concentrated and of a serious character, idealistic but never passionate in an emotional sense.\n\nIn the case of women the contact often means the sacrifice of the personal desires on the altar of family ties and obligations.','Charles E.O.

With a prominent Mars there may be ability for work in metals.\n\nIt tends somewhat to eccentricity, sentiment, and romance, the passions being very sensitive.\n\nIn many cases it seems to be rather a dumb note and goes no further than a mild liking for music.\n\nSo far as externals are concerned it favors popularity, easy circumstances, and enjoyable, though not always steadfast, relations with the other sex. Very much depends upon the ability of the native to find an adequate outlet for the emotional nature, for there is a proclivity towards adventures in love, and the romantic part of the nature may lead to looseness of conduct unless it can be &ldquo;sublimated&rdquo; in some harmless way. For example, Petrarch with Venus in Gemini trine Uranus in Libra, expressed his romantic nature by writing sonnets to Laura, while living a perfectly comfortable and respectable life with a wife and several children, being plump and well-fed at a time when, according to his writings, Love denied him food, sleep, and most other necessaries. Or, again, romance may be sought in stranger directions, as in the case of William Blake, who was most happily married, but allowed the eccentricity of Uranus to find vent for itself in such peculiar habits as insisting on receiving and entertaining his guests in a completely unclothed condition, by way of demonstrating beyond all argument the fact of his having regained man&apos;s pristine &ldquo;innocence of childhood pure.&rdquo; Another eccentric, but (so far as I know) perfectly moral Venus-Uranus man was Joseph Smith, the Mormon, who &ldquo;rationalized&rdquo; the inner cravings of the aspect by producing a polygamous religion, miraculously revealed.\n\nOn the other hand, we owe it to this aspect to record that Queen Victoria had it; but it was wide and separating.

Even among such there are many who are unable to express the effects in such manner as to render them intelligible to others.\n\nProbably the contact is most easily expressed in the form of music, but it may also come through the finer expressions of other forms of art, and in the hands of genius, it may be, even appear in the guise of poetry. It is pre-eminently the artist combination and is more nearly related to beauty than to either the moral or the scientific spheres.\n\nIt is sympathetic, but, like most Venus contacts, there is some limitation in the practical expression of sympathy; it is too refined an influence to care about work of any sordid description.\n\nAmong ordinary people it usually signifies good taste, a liking for music and other forms of art, good nature but much emotionalism, with little capacity for settled employment or hard work, except of an artistic character. It may be dreamy and visionary.\n\nThere may be high spiritual development, but in itself the influence is not sufficiently powerful to achieve much either on the mystic path or any other&mdash;in this respect the inharmonious aspects, being more energetic, are better. Sometimes it may indicate a tendency to indolence and dependence on others; it is certainly likely to cause others to be helpful to the native in his need.\n\nOn the practical side it is good for all matters under the houses occupied and ruled, and for all transactions with Venus-Neptunian persons, such as artists, actors, musicians, and young women who are in any way connected with the sea or the seaside. Similarly the Neptune influence may come through other Neptunian channels, such as liquor, tobacco, drugs, or marine affairs. It favors easy fortunes and a certain degree of luxury, but it can be its own enemy through imprudence and lack of energy and sense.\n\nIn respect of health this combination is never very important, and even good aspects tend to a certain delicacy of constitution and a susceptible bodily condition.','Charles E.O.

But the polygamous or varietist tendency should rather be attributed to the action of Jupiter and Uranus; and the Venus-Mars person, once married, may be faithful, though ardent. To speak of all persons with afflictions between these bodies as more or less libidinous is both inaccurate and unjust.

But if there are saving aspects there will probably be separation such as might result from emigration, life at sea, or similar causes not of a tragic kind.\n\nThese planets seem also to be frequently found in mutual aspect in explorers&apos; maps.\n\nThis species of configuration does not favor happiness, and this for a double reason: the native does actually meet more than his due share of unkindness, and, besides this, he is usually more sensitive than the average person to it. Venus has much to do with interior happiness, as Jupiter influences exterior prosperity, and the bad aspects of Mars put this happiness, so to speak, at the mercy of the rough and rude elements of life. Venus also rules adaptation and all forms of mutuality and relationship, and the bad aspect of Mars causes these to be unfortunate in some manner or other. Venus is also significatrix of those from whom affection may normally be expected (in particular mother, sisters, wife) and the action of Mars tends to make these persons either harsh and non-understanding, or it may remove them.\n\nIt is true that Mars does impart some robustness of temper, so that the native generally reacts to injuries in anger rather than grief, and this is a more comfortable condition. But as Mars diminishes the Venus charm, so Venus weakens the courage and hardihood of Mars. If Mars predominates we may see a liking for horseplay (cf. Kaiser Wilhelm II); if Venus predominates, then there is such sensitiveness that the least roughness has a prostrating effect.\n\nThe lack of real content makes the Venus-Mars person dissatisfied with himself and a keen critic of others; he cannot take people and things as he finds them; he feels too much and expects too much.\n\nHe is often warmly, but capriciously, affectionate.\n\nThe affliction does not, as is sometimes thought, center round the married and other inter-sexual relations. There will be emotional trouble, and naturally this will often be expressed in the above manner, but the family-life&mdash;and particularly the early family-life&mdash;is also often the field wherein the contacts will operate. It is rare to find a person with them who has not lost, or suffered through or at the hands of, one of the parents, who may be unfortunate in his affairs, die, or practice harshness to the native. In married life the influence is by no means always towards disagreement or unhappiness&mdash;in fact, there may be ardent affection. But separation by force of circumstances is common. For example, the husband may be obliged to travel, or, again, conditions of health or business may cause separation in some form or other. It tends also to deny or harm the children, and as a rule there are but one or two.\n\nIn fifteen cases before me the fathers died or were unusually harsh in eight, to my personal knowledge. In three cases there was family disaster. Other cases were that psychologically unfortunate person, the only child, or there was but one brother or sister, and that one died.\n\nThe bad aspects do not prevent marriage&mdash;indeed, they seem to promote it in female genitures, perhaps because the pains of parturition are an appropriate field for the expression of these influences. But the woman who weds a man with this affliction may find him dominating, not too refined, egotistical, touchy, and sometimes unprepossessing in appearance. If she have it herself, then the husband may be licentious, sickly, or unfortunate. These rules are of course subject to countervailing influences.\n\nThe health may be affected through worry, strain, and lack of interior tranquillity, or through hurt to the feelings or sorrow. It may likewise denote harm through self-indulgence.','Charles E.O. Carter',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Again, in some cases there is conceit without idleness. I have never found any of them conspicuous for unassuming modesty, nor do they seek the corner of the room or yearn to blush unseen. Oftentimes they like to strike a dramatic note, with themselves, be it understood, in the center of the stage. Sometimes there is an element of profusion. The feelings are frequently susceptible and the love-affairs numerous. But a prominent malefic influence will readily introduce a much sterner element into the character, and we may get the second or rebellious type.\n\nIt is a rather passive note in many cases, and its influence is specially liable to be overlaid by more positive factors, so that, although it can be plainly detected on analysis, its specific manifestations are almost always determined for it. The gist of its influence is &ast;excess of feeling&ast;.\n\nThere is an element of change and even adventure in the lives of most natives with this combination, and sometimes they are veritable storm-centers. The influence of Jupiter is always restless and prone to seek fresh experiences and variations on old ones; it represents the principle of Cosmic Variety, or the concept of one branch developing into many ramifications. The matters ruled by the two planets will clash or injure each other : for example, love or finance or both will suffer through foreigners or foreign travel, law, or some other 9th house matter, or perhaps through things of the 12th house.\n\nThe effect on &ast;health&ast; is probably slight, but Venus afflictions may always cause indulgence, and Jupiter inclines to excess in all directions.','Charles E.O.

A sort of mean jealousy, unredeemed by the romance of Uranus or even the passion of Mars, may be observed, and, with Mercury-Mars afflictions, nagging may occur. Wives may carry punctuality to such a point that lateness at a meal may mean a day of disharmony; husbands may be household tyrants waging constant battle over domestic accounts.\n\nOne may credit Venus-Saturn natives with fidelity; they are often very cold in some part of their nature, and, even with ascendants such as Taurus or Libra, may astonish one with unsuspected hardness.\n\nThe life is generally a hard one, either through poverty or worldly failure, or, if this does not occur owing to other counteracting indications, then there is usually either depression and moodiness, loneliness (often with bereavement), or ill-health. This last is, however, the least characteristic feature of the configuration, which centers above all in the emotional and affectional spheres.\n\nChildhood does not seem to suffer particularly, as is usually the case with Venus-Mars aspects, but one of the parents&mdash;as a rule the father&mdash;is apt to be a burden. Frequently he is a forceful, tyrannical, exacting, or dominating type, whose will allows little free development in his children. Sometimes, though less often, he is unpractical, a failure, and a financial burden to his family. Sometimes his early death is denoted, and step-parents may occur. He is rather likely, in some instances, to require his children to grow up too soon, to realize their responsibilities too early, and to work more strenuously than an all-round unfoldment might call for.\n\nThe mother is often affected and is as a rule strongly tinged with Saturnian characteristics, as in the way of being ambitious, worldly, snobbish, or aloof.\n\nGenerally there is apt to be a condition of &ldquo;fixation&rdquo; in respect of one or both parents. The child is too strongly marked with their impress and tries to grow into their likeness or that of one of them, each sex tending to assimilate itself to the parent of the opposite gender. Sometimes the limitation is more purely external, as when the child has to deny itself to support its parents in old age. But the general effect of the parents on the child is in the direction of increasing its seriousness and its responsibilities, and those born with this configuration are peculiarly susceptible to this sort of influence, which is none the less detrimental because often exceedingly well-intentioned.\n\nIn marriage it can be easily understood that Venus-Saturn afflictions act very badly. The good aspects are compatible with great happiness and mutual love, but even thus, bereavement and other forms of separation are possible. Considerable differences of age, and less often of social status, are common both with good and bad aspects.\n\nBad aspects may delay marriage or even assist in preventing it altogether. If it occurs, then ill-health or misfortune often befalls the partner, or gradual estrangement may ensue, in which respect the aspect (if it takes this form at all) is very deadly and far more dangerous in my experience than Venus-Mars.\n\nIt must be frankly stated that this combination is of a serious kind. I have certainly known cases wherein a minor evil aspect has apparently been completely externalized&mdash;that is to say, the character does not seem to have suffered at all&mdash;yet one cannot but imagine that true peace and joy are difficult to attain for those who have such contacts. As a rule either the life is exceptionally sad, or the nature is such that normal misfortunes are felt abnormally.

There may be talent for music, literature, or the drama.\n\nThough far less depressing than the evil aspects of Venus and Saturn, this combination has a tendency to make the native extremely &ldquo;touchy,&rdquo; so that cooperation of any kind becomes almost impossible. There is self-will, and sometimes an unusual rigidity of outlook and opinion from which the native cannot be moved; indeed it often happens that he will refuse to discuss his reasons or motives. The feelings seem subtly to dominate the will, so that the native, while remaining outwardly rational and logical, will persist in an unfortunate course, and will refuse to give way or concede anything, with the strange unreasonableness of the Uranian. The character is often good and kind, but the orientation of the will is, as it were, distorted.\n\nUnfortunate associates menace the life, both in love and in business, as well as in other ways. In marriage the partner is uncongenial or dies, and sometimes the native is changeful or exacting or eccentric. It inclines to peculiar and unconventional ideas about sex, and the native often has an exaggerated idea of independence and personal freedom, overlooking the fact that man is naturally gregarious and is more or less dependent on his fellows, whether he cares to admit this dependence or not. But the aspect does not incline to promiscuity or vulgar vice, and its connection with sexual perversion has probably been extremely exaggerated.\n\nIt may concur with other features to signify tragic separations and bereavements either in marriage or other near relationships.\n\nIt is a somewhat common feature in the nativities of suicides, and it is also sometimes found in the horoscopes of child-victims of assault and sexual offences, so that children possessing it should be carefully protected.\n\nIt is not favorable with regard to the mother, who may die early, or be unfortunate or uncongenial.\n\nIt inclines to nervous instability and various nervous afflictions, probably due to repressed or defeated desires, for the desire-nature is strong and does not easily submit to repulse or rejection.

This is particularly so in matters of the affections. The ideals are indeed very high, and there may be a persistent dissatisfaction both with things and persons, varying from a petulant or peevish attitude, to a noble aspiration and persistent endeavor to seek for a fuller realization of inner visions. There may be a difficulty in adapting oneself to surroundings or to people with whom contact is made; almost always the affections are extremely sensitive and responsive.\n\nThe devotion to art may be as great as with the good aspects, but there will be difficulty in following this path, or there may be eccentricities of expression&mdash;nevertheless, the inharmonious combinations are frequently found in the nativities of great artists.\n\nAlthough the good aspects of these two planets are naturally more favorable for happiness and easy conditions, it seems that, so far as achievement, moral character, and artistic ability go, the inharmonious aspects are in no way inferior to them; in fact, they may be better inasmuch as they may produce more energy.\n\nA tendency to &ldquo;sit on the fence&rdquo; and to avoid definiteness in judgment and action seems sometimes to occur.\n\nAs a result of the fact that the emotional nature is abnormally sensitive and unstable, happiness in all relationships with others, and particularly in marriage, is frequently endangered, a slight difference often assuming imaginary importance, whilst the native may easily form clandestine connections with others owing to his or her extreme susceptibility to affectional influences, coupled with a dislike of open rupture or violent &ldquo;scenes.&rdquo;\n\nThis tendency externalizes in the shape of confused and deceptive conditions, uncertainty, treachery, and instability.\n\nThe imagination is very active and this may also lead to moral lapses.\n\nMuch the same circumstances generally arise in the matters of the 2nd house. The native may himself be victimized, or, in a generally weak natus, there may be attempts to defraud others. Sometimes it is to be observed that the native himself seems to have some kind of mental warp which makes him unable to see clearly in these matters, so that he appears hardly to realize what he is doing and his very victims cannot believe that his intentions have been evil. In money matters persons with this contact should be careful to avoid any sort of entanglements and would do well carefully to avoid anything that has the Neptunian characteristics; they may otherwise easily be involved in some kind of &ldquo;South Sea Bubble&rdquo; collapse.\n\nFemales ought to be particularly careful in their male associates, for the contact threatens deception, and the men that are met are likely sometimes to prove by no means what they seem. Any trace of addiction to drink or drugs may point to something very serious. Sometimes ultimate ruin is hidden by an illusive preliminary happiness.\n\nIn a word, the native should practice utter directness and straightforwardness in all his dealings, and should rigidly require the same behavior from others, in so far as it is in his power to do so.\n\nOften the reputation suffers through questionable relationships, and sex or finance are usually the grounds of attack. One may mention Nicholas II of Russia, who suffered destruction in large part through Rasputin, the monk.\n\nNeedless to say, any psychic or other mediumistic practices are particularly dangerous to those with these positions.\n\nSince Venus has a general reference to objects of affection, these contacts may indicate anxiety with regard to the mother, sisters, children, and even pets.\n\nThe health is usually to some extent affected; and if either planet has special reference to physical well-being, then sensitiveness, especially to drugs, may be expected. The vicinity of the sea is harmful, and dry bracing air is beneficial.\n\nThere is often a tendency to experiment with diet and to practice vegetarianism, owing to the sensitive character of the contact.

The great gift of the combination seems to be grace of expression, although this may be expressed in some forms only. As a rule the grace is verbal, but sometimes it would be more true to say that there is an attractive grace of demeanor. I have occasionally noticed this even in persons with Venus and Jupiter in bad aspect, provided they are in congenial signs. A case like that of Tennyson shows that the grace of expression may be expressed only through writing, for he was often gruff in his behavior. Sometimes there are oratorical abilities.\n\nOften the feelings are capricious and restless, so that connubial happiness does not always accompany this contact, nor is the native always happy in disposition : its chief influence seems certainly to be in the direction of art and literature.\n\nIt promotes popularity and affection, so benefiting anyone who has to do with the public, especially in the way of amusing or pleasing them. It is less good for those who must correct or instruct.\n\nThe effects of this combination on the health are often considerable, and it seems often to promote longevity, perhaps because the influence of Venus tempers and moderates the Jovian tendency towards excess and hazardous conduct.','Charles E.O.

For example, in my cases of suicide there is exactly the same number of the one class as of the other. It would seem that some bodies are of a naturally antagonistic character, so that even the harmony of a trine or sextile cannot altogether weld their influences into harmony. Naturally this failure of the good aspects to produce good is the more noticeable when either Venus or Saturn is otherwise weak by sign or aspect. In some fifty cases that I have tabulated it is extremely hard to differentiate the good from the bad aspects by a mere reference to the facts of the life and character of each native : some of the unhappiest have had the former, and vice versa.\n\nVenus is naturally a light-spirited influence, and any contact of Saturn seems to quench this : &ldquo;chill as a dull face frowning on a song.&rdquo; Saturn is stern reality forcing itself upon our happy moments that are born of Venus.\n\nBut with the harmonious aspects it is probable that not only are the actual effects alleviated, even if we cannot measure this mitigation, but there is the possibility of considerable spiritual beauty, born of material hardship and the absence of the ordinary pleasures of life. Indeed these are often willingly rejected for the sake of some ideal. The burden is born, but it is carried gladly. Saturn is irradiated by Venus, and the &ldquo;spiritual marriage&rdquo; may be consummated.\n\nIn all cases the affections are likely to be very concentrated and of a serious character, idealistic but never passionate in an emotional sense.\n\nIn the case of women the contact often means the sacrifice of the personal desires on the altar of family ties and obligations.','Charles E.O.

Very much depends upon the ability of the native to find an adequate outlet for the emotional nature, for there is a proclivity towards adventures in love, and the romantic part of the nature may lead to looseness of conduct unless it can be &ldquo;sublimated&rdquo; in some harmless way. For example, Petrarch with Venus in Gemini trine Uranus in Libra, expressed his romantic nature by writing sonnets to Laura, while living a perfectly comfortable and respectable life with a wife and several children, being plump and well-fed at a time when, according to his writings, Love denied him food, sleep, and most other necessaries. Or, again, romance may be sought in stranger directions, as in the case of William Blake, who was most happily married, but allowed the eccentricity of Uranus to find vent for itself in such peculiar habits as insisting on receiving and entertaining his guests in a completely unclothed condition, by way of demonstrating beyond all argument the fact of his having regained man&apos;s pristine &ldquo;innocence of childhood pure.&rdquo; Another eccentric, but (so far as I know) perfectly moral Venus-Uranus man was Joseph Smith, the Mormon, who &ldquo;rationalized&rdquo; the inner cravings of the aspect by producing a polygamous religion, miraculously revealed.\n\nOn the other hand, we owe it to this aspect to record that Queen Victoria had it; but it was wide and separating.

Even among such there are many who are unable to express the effects in such manner as to render them intelligible to others.\n\nProbably the contact is most easily expressed in the form of music, but it may also come through the finer expressions of other forms of art, and in the hands of genius, it may be, even appear in the guise of poetry. It is pre-eminently the artist combination and is more nearly related to beauty than to either the moral or the scientific spheres.\n\nIt is sympathetic, but, like most Venus contacts, there is some limitation in the practical expression of sympathy; it is too refined an influence to care about work of any sordid description.\n\nAmong ordinary people it usually signifies good taste, a liking for music and other forms of art, good nature but much emotionalism, with little capacity for settled employment or hard work, except of an artistic character. It may be dreamy and visionary.\n\nThere may be high spiritual development, but in itself the influence is not sufficiently powerful to achieve much either on the mystic path or any other&mdash;in this respect the inharmonious aspects, being more energetic, are better. Sometimes it may indicate a tendency to indolence and dependence on others; it is certainly likely to cause others to be helpful to the native in his need.\n\nOn the practical side it is good for all matters under the houses occupied and ruled, and for all transactions with Venus-Neptunian persons, such as artists, actors, musicians, and young women who are in any way connected with the sea or the seaside. Similarly the Neptune influence may come through other Neptunian channels, such as liquor, tobacco, drugs, or marine affairs. It favors easy fortunes and a certain degree of luxury, but it can be its own enemy through imprudence and lack of energy and sense.\n\nIn respect of health this combination is never very important, and even good aspects tend to a certain delicacy of constitution and a susceptible bodily condition.','Charles E.O.

But the polygamous or varietist tendency should rather be attributed to the action of Jupiter and Uranus; and the Venus-Mars person, once married, may be faithful, though ardent. To speak of all persons with afflictions between these bodies as more or less libidinous is both inaccurate and unjust. Sometimes it is rather an indication of being the victim of immorality in some form or other.\n\nThere is usually a liking for dancing, singing, and music with all Venus-Mars aspects.\n\nThese contacts tend notably to operate early in life. For example, a bad aspect between them may cause separation or unhappiness in the first years of married life, but there will always be the hope of better circumstances later.\n\nThey seem to be related to children and one&apos;s fondness for them, say to the age of puberty, after which I think Jupiter might have to be considered and probably Mars and the Sun also. Good aspects tend to affectionate relations with them, but the square probably causes them to be disliked or to be a source of sorrow. Good aspects show benefit from one&apos;s children; for instance, Gladstone, whose good name has been vigorously upheld by his son, had them in sextile; James I, whose son (and mother) were beheaded, had them in square; Sir Harry Lauder (conjunction) lost his only son. But if there are saving aspects there will probably be separation such as might result from emigration, life at sea, or similar causes not of a tragic kind.\n\nThese planets seem also to be frequently found in mutual aspect in explorers&apos; maps.\n\nThis species of configuration does not favor happiness, and this for a double reason: the native does actually meet more than his due share of unkindness, and, besides this, he is usually more sensitive than the average person to it. Venus has much to do with interior happiness, as Jupiter influences exterior prosperity, and the bad aspects of Mars put this happiness, so to speak, at the mercy of the rough and rude elements of life. Venus also rules adaptation and all forms of mutuality and relationship, and the bad aspect of Mars causes these to be unfortunate in some manner or other. Venus is also significatrix of those from whom affection may normally be expected (in particular mother, sisters, wife) and the action of Mars tends to make these persons either harsh and non-understanding, or it may remove them.\n\nIt is true that Mars does impart some robustness of temper, so that the native generally reacts to injuries in anger rather than grief, and this is a more comfortable condition. But as Mars diminishes the Venus charm, so Venus weakens the courage and hardihood of Mars. If Mars predominates we may see a liking for horseplay (cf. Kaiser Wilhelm II); if Venus predominates, then there is such sensitiveness that the least roughness has a prostrating effect.\n\nThe lack of real content makes the Venus-Mars person dissatisfied with himself and a keen critic of others; he cannot take people and things as he finds them; he feels too much and expects too much.\n\nHe is often warmly, but capriciously, affectionate.\n\nThe affliction does not, as is sometimes thought, center round the married and other inter-sexual relations. There will be emotional trouble, and naturally this will often be expressed in the above manner, but the family-life&mdash;and particularly the early family-life&mdash;is also often the field wherein the contacts will operate. It is rare to find a person with them who has not lost, or suffered through or at the hands of, one of the parents, who may be unfortunate in his affairs, die, or practice harshness to the native. In married life the influence is by no means always towards disagreement or unhappiness&mdash;in fact, there may be ardent affection. But separation by force of circumstances is common. For example, the husband may be obliged to travel, or, again, conditions of health or business may cause separation in some form or other. It tends also to deny or harm the children, and as a rule there are but one or two.\n\nIn fifteen cases before me the fathers died or were unusually harsh in eight, to my personal knowledge. In three cases there was family disaster. Other cases were that psychologically unfortunate person, the only child, or there was but one brother or sister, and that one died.\n\nThe bad aspects do not prevent marriage&mdash;indeed, they seem to promote it in female genitures, perhaps because the pains of parturition are an appropriate field for the expression of these influences. But the woman who weds a man with this affliction may find him dominating, not too refined, egotistical, touchy, and sometimes unprepossessing in appearance. If she have it herself, then the husband may be licentious, sickly, or unfortunate. These rules are of course subject to countervailing influences.\n\nThe health may be affected through worry, strain, and lack of interior tranquillity, or through hurt to the feelings or sorrow. It may likewise denote harm through self-indulgence.','Charles E.O. Carter',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Again, in some cases there is conceit without idleness. I have never found any of them conspicuous for unassuming modesty, nor do they seek the corner of the room or yearn to blush unseen. Oftentimes they like to strike a dramatic note, with themselves, be it understood, in the center of the stage. Sometimes there is an element of profusion. The feelings are frequently susceptible and the love-affairs numerous. But a prominent malefic influence will readily introduce a much sterner element into the character, and we may get the second or rebellious type.\n\nIt is a rather passive note in many cases, and its influence is specially liable to be overlaid by more positive factors, so that, although it can be plainly detected on analysis, its specific manifestations are almost always determined for it. The gist of its influence is &ast;excess of feeling&ast;.\n\nThere is an element of change and even adventure in the lives of most natives with this combination, and sometimes they are veritable storm-centers. The influence of Jupiter is always restless and prone to seek fresh experiences and variations on old ones; it represents the principle of Cosmic Variety, or the concept of one branch developing into many ramifications. The matters ruled by the two planets will clash or injure each other : for example, love or finance or both will suffer through foreigners or foreign travel, law, or some other 9th house matter, or perhaps through things of the 12th house.\n\nThe effect on &ast;health&ast; is probably slight, but Venus afflictions may always cause indulgence, and Jupiter inclines to excess in all directions.','Charles E.O.

A sort of mean jealousy, unredeemed by the romance of Uranus or even the passion of Mars, may be observed, and, with Mercury-Mars afflictions, nagging may occur. Wives may carry punctuality to such a point that lateness at a meal may mean a day of disharmony; husbands may be household tyrants waging constant battle over domestic accounts.\n\nOne may credit Venus-Saturn natives with fidelity; they are often very cold in some part of their nature, and, even with ascendants such as Taurus or Libra, may astonish one with unsuspected hardness.\n\nThe life is generally a hard one, either through poverty or worldly failure, or, if this does not occur owing to other counteracting indications, then there is usually either depression and moodiness, loneliness (often with bereavement), or ill-health. This last is, however, the least characteristic feature of the configuration, which centers above all in the emotional and affectional spheres.\n\nChildhood does not seem to suffer particularly, as is usually the case with Venus-Mars aspects, but one of the parents&mdash;as a rule the father&mdash;is apt to be a burden. Frequently he is a forceful, tyrannical, exacting, or dominating type, whose will allows little free development in his children. Sometimes, though less often, he is unpractical, a failure, and a financial burden to his family. Sometimes his early death is denoted, and step-parents may occur. He is rather likely, in some instances, to require his children to grow up too soon, to realize their responsibilities too early, and to work more strenuously than an all-round unfoldment might call for.\n\nThe mother is often affected and is as a rule strongly tinged with Saturnian characteristics, as in the way of being ambitious, worldly, snobbish, or aloof.\n\nGenerally there is apt to be a condition of &ldquo;fixation&rdquo; in respect of one or both parents. The child is too strongly marked with their impress and tries to grow into their likeness or that of one of them, each sex tending to assimilate itself to the parent of the opposite gender. Sometimes the limitation is more purely external, as when the child has to deny itself to support its parents in old age. But the general effect of the parents on the child is in the direction of increasing its seriousness and its responsibilities, and those born with this configuration are peculiarly susceptible to this sort of influence, which is none the less detrimental because often exceedingly well-intentioned.\n\nIn marriage it can be easily understood that Venus-Saturn afflictions act very badly. The good aspects are compatible with great happiness and mutual love, but even thus, bereavement and other forms of separation are possible. Considerable differences of age, and less often of social status, are common both with good and bad aspects.\n\nBad aspects may delay marriage or even assist in preventing it altogether. If it occurs, then ill-health or misfortune often befalls the partner, or gradual estrangement may ensue, in which respect the aspect (if it takes this form at all) is very deadly and far more dangerous in my experience than Venus-Mars.\n\nIt must be frankly stated that this combination is of a serious kind. I have certainly known cases wherein a minor evil aspect has apparently been completely externalized&mdash;that is to say, the character does not seem to have suffered at all&mdash;yet one cannot but imagine that true peace and joy are difficult to attain for those who have such contacts. As a rule either the life is exceptionally sad, or the nature is such that normal misfortunes are felt abnormally.

There is self-will, and sometimes an unusual rigidity of outlook and opinion from which the native cannot be moved; indeed it often happens that he will refuse to discuss his reasons or motives. The feelings seem subtly to dominate the will, so that the native, while remaining outwardly rational and logical, will persist in an unfortunate course, and will refuse to give way or concede anything, with the strange unreasonableness of the Uranian. The character is often good and kind, but the orientation of the will is, as it were, distorted.\n\nUnfortunate associates menace the life, both in love and in business, as well as in other ways. In marriage the partner is uncongenial or dies, and sometimes the native is changeful or exacting or eccentric. It inclines to peculiar and unconventional ideas about sex, and the native often has an exaggerated idea of independence and personal freedom, overlooking the fact that man is naturally gregarious and is more or less dependent on his fellows, whether he cares to admit this dependence or not. But the aspect does not incline to promiscuity or vulgar vice, and its connection with sexual perversion has probably been extremely exaggerated.\n\nIt may concur with other features to signify tragic separations and bereavements either in marriage or other near relationships.\n\nIt is a somewhat common feature in the nativities of suicides, and it is also sometimes found in the horoscopes of child-victims of assault and sexual offences, so that children possessing it should be carefully protected.\n\nIt is not favorable with regard to the mother, who may die early, or be unfortunate or uncongenial.\n\nIt inclines to nervous instability and various nervous afflictions, probably due to repressed or defeated desires, for the desire-nature is strong and does not easily submit to repulse or rejection.

This is particularly so in matters of the affections. The ideals are indeed very high, and there may be a persistent dissatisfaction both with things and persons, varying from a petulant or peevish attitude, to a noble aspiration and persistent endeavor to seek for a fuller realization of inner visions. There may be a difficulty in adapting oneself to surroundings or to people with whom contact is made; almost always the affections are extremely sensitive and responsive.\n\nThe devotion to art may be as great as with the good aspects, but there will be difficulty in following this path, or there may be eccentricities of expression&mdash;nevertheless, the inharmonious combinations are frequently found in the nativities of great artists.\n\nAlthough the good aspects of these two planets are naturally more favorable for happiness and easy conditions, it seems that, so far as achievement, moral character, and artistic ability go, the inharmonious aspects are in no way inferior to them; in fact, they may be better inasmuch as they may produce more energy.\n\nA tendency to &ldquo;sit on the fence&rdquo; and to avoid definiteness in judgment and action seems sometimes to occur.\n\nAs a result of the fact that the emotional nature is abnormally sensitive and unstable, happiness in all relationships with others, and particularly in marriage, is frequently endangered, a slight difference often assuming imaginary importance, whilst the native may easily form clandestine connections with others owing to his or her extreme susceptibility to affectional influences, coupled with a dislike of open rupture or violent &ldquo;scenes.&rdquo;\n\nThis tendency externalizes in the shape of confused and deceptive conditions, uncertainty, treachery, and instability.\n\nThe imagination is very active and this may also lead to moral lapses.\n\nMuch the same circumstances generally arise in the matters of the 2nd house.

Sometimes it is to be observed that the native himself seems to have some kind of mental warp which makes him unable to see clearly in these matters, so that he appears hardly to realize what he is doing and his very victims cannot believe that his intentions have been evil. In money matters persons with this contact should be careful to avoid any sort of entanglements and would do well carefully to avoid anything that has the Neptunian characteristics; they may otherwise easily be involved in some kind of &ldquo;South Sea Bubble&rdquo; collapse.\n\nFemales ought to be particularly careful in their male associates, for the contact threatens deception, and the men that are met are likely sometimes to prove by no means what they seem. Any trace of addiction to drink or drugs may point to something very serious. Sometimes ultimate ruin is hidden by an illusive preliminary happiness.\n\nIn a word, the native should practice utter directness and straightforwardness in all his dealings, and should rigidly require the same behavior from others, in so far as it is in his power to do so.\n\nOften the reputation suffers through questionable relationships, and sex or finance are usually the grounds of attack. One may mention Nicholas II of Russia, who suffered destruction in large part through Rasputin, the monk.\n\nNeedless to say, any psychic or other mediumistic practices are particularly dangerous to those with these positions.\n\nSince Venus has a general reference to objects of affection, these contacts may indicate anxiety with regard to the mother, sisters, children, and even pets.\n\nThe health is usually to some extent affected; and if either planet has special reference to physical well-being, then sensitiveness, especially to drugs, may be expected. The vicinity of the sea is harmful, and dry bracing air is beneficial.\n\nThere is often a tendency to experiment with diet and to practice vegetarianism, owing to the sensitive character of the contact.

If other influences agree there may be a distinct danger of unusual physical suffering. It occurs in the nativities of several victims of violence (such as Don Carlos of Portugal, and Mrs. Bennett, who was strangled in 1900 at Yarmouth Beach). All inharmonious combinations of these planets appear to point this way. In the map of Elisabeth, the Empress of Austria, the two planets are in mutual reception. In one case (conj. in Virgo in 2nd) there was great suffering from both eczema and gout with chronic irritation.

It is said that Cicero also had Mars conjoined with Uranus in Capricorn in the 12th, and his life and death contained bloodshed and tragedy.\n\nCases Nos. 145 and 146 in Notable Nativities seem to imply that inharmonious aspects between these planets may in some measure denote weak-mindedness, probably through an actual malformation of the brain (Mars).','Charles E.O.

It does not favor the &ldquo;middle path.&rdquo; One may cite the ascetic Gandhi.\n\nDiscontent and resentment sometimes appear, and there may be an inclination to give little and demand much; there may be extremist tendencies in politics.\n\nSometimes there may be inordinate avarice and sometimes equally inordinate extravagance.

Or there may be incompetence, muddle, carelessness, or treachery, the influence having points in common with Mars-Neptune, except that the circumstances of operation are generally less subtle and more usual. Thus it is easier to guard against; the native is his own enemy, and he may benefit considerably, if he will, by learning the lesson of his horoscope and taking needful precautions. He ought to avoid speculations of all kinds, but particularly those of a Jovian character, such as are connected with shipping, exploration, horses, the stage, films, the boot-trade, moneylending, drugs, and liquor. It must be recollected that Jupiter, on its negative side, rules much the same things as Neptune.\n\nThe effects on the health are likely to be through over-strain, over-excitement, over-enthusiasm, and so forth; these people are commonly poor resters.

Again, the severity may be turned inward and there may be an inner austerity and self-discipline.\n\nIts chief effect on character appears to be of a quite different kind. The Saturnian influence acts as a brake on the Martian energies, and I have certainly often noticed a sort of erraticity in these people, so that their enthusiasms are sudden and violent, but short-lasting, with alternations of &ldquo;blowing hot&rdquo; and &ldquo;blowing cold.&rdquo; Sometimes there are spells of laziness, due to the inhibition of the Mars action; sometimes there is a restless energy without good directing common sense when Mars overcomes Saturn. Definite purpose often seems lacking, as if the native regarded life as something of a child&apos;s game, passing from one interest to another lightly and inconsequentially. However much in earnest such people are (and often they seem very much so), I have noticed that they commonly forget their pursuits as soon as they cease to amuse them. True depth is generally deficient. In one case there was great love of starting fresh enterprises and considerable ability in this way; but the native soon lost interest in them when the initial difficulties had been surmounted, and left them to another : here Mars was also square Uranus.\n\nThere is usually a certain amount of selfishness or egoism. Thus, even when there is real kindness of heart, the native likes to go his own way, and will not readily turn aside from what interests him personally in order to minister to others. There is an inclination to impatience with those who do not readily agree.\n\nExteriorly Mars-Saturn tends to a life of hardship and suffering, as well as to the undergoing of physical violence.\n\nThe former may occur in the way of health. There is a danger of strain and excess; and this may be followed by the need for prolonged rest, rigid attention to dietetic and other restrictions, and otherwise &ldquo;paying the price.&rdquo;\n\nIt seems to have a distinct affinity with enteric fever.\n\nThere is also a liability to burns and scaldings.\n\nThe square is not uncommon in the horoscopes of victims of murder, as for instance King Umberto I, five-year-old strangling victim Willie Starchfield, and Savonarola. In all such cases other potent factors will occur in addition, for the bad aspect of two planets (as apart from Sun, Moon, and Angles) cannot, however serious, destroy the life prematurely or violently.\n\nGeneral Charles Gordon had the two planets in trine, but Mars was debilitated by sign, in Taurus in the 2nd house. The same occurs in the case of Alexander II of Russia (killed by bomb), with Mars in Cancer in the 12th.\n\nIt does not by any means forbid success, though this will come late and after severe struggles.\n\nThese planets in combination nearly always add to the energy, although, as stated, there may be great fitfulness of activity, and, in inharmonious cases, a lack of tact and common-sense in dealing with others.\n\nMars-Saturn seems connected with fire in a wide sense, for Warren Leland, who lost wife and daughter in a great fire and died of shock in consequence, had them in conjunction. Also Dr. Alfred Russell Wallace, who lost his scientific collections by fire, had them in square. In another case communicated to me privately an officer with this aspect was recommended for the D.S.O., but never received this decoration because the papers were destroyed by fire and the recommending officer was killed at the same time.','Charles E.O.

There is no lack of energy, but it is often fitful and ill-directed, and the native is often a relative failure, being unable for some reason to make as good use of his talents as might reasonably be expected. Ill-temper is common, but is not always present; sometimes there is a tendency rather to fretfulness and erratic self-will; the native may be blunt and abrupt, or irritable and querulous. Sometimes the nervous conditions lead to shyness and retirement. The native is often what is known as edgy or ornery, and is frequently not well-fitted for ordinary existence; it is distinctly unfavorable for married life or for any restricted or ordered way of living, but it is not an aspect which as a rule indicates any essential ill-nature or vice.\n\nLike all combinations which create a desire for freedom and unrestriction, this often externalizes in the shape of suicidal tendencies, the native being unfitted to brook patiently the checks and delays that occur in most walks of life. Patience is a virtue that is seldom present, and humility is also rare. The native is likely to scorn diplomacy and any kind of maneuvering, and is prone to throw up the sponge as soon as this is called for. In a word, he wants his own way at all costs.\n\nAs we have mentioned before, there are often attacks on the native&apos;s morals or honor, and sometimes there are direct assaults on his person, provided other more vital points are afflicted as well.\n\nAccidents are not infrequent, and these aspects do not make for longevity, for there is seldom much placidity with Mars-Uranus, and the ability to acquiesce cheerfully and readily in the dispensations of Providence is not often very noticeable.\n\nThere is often a disposition to take risks, and to overwork.','Charles E.O.

These aspects do undoubtedly stimulate the imagination immensely, so that, if the mind is of a sordid character, the fancies take their hue from it, and revel in impurity, sometimes with external results of a grave kind. On the other hand, in an otherwise good natus, the influence may be harmlessly, and even usefully, discharged in some direction wherein the imagination can receive adequate scope. Hence we find this contact exceedingly common in the maps of actors and painters, singers, dancers, and others following cognate pursuits. It is also by no means rare in the maps of astrologers, because the lofty and sublime character of our art gives scope for the exalted flights of the imagination. Ordinary life is too humdrum and colorless for the Mars-Neptune native; hence he seeks pursuits that are capable of appealing to the romantic and grandeur-loving elements of the soul. That some seek a false satisfaction in the realms of the drug-taker and the sensualist does not alter the basic character of the aspect.\n\nNevertheless, high emotionalism may lead to serious conditions. The native is often slow to admit error. His abilities may fall short of his aspirations&mdash;indeed they are sure to do so; hence there may be a poignant sense of failure, often due to some inner neurotic condition rather than to an outward and tangible obstacle. The contact often breeds irrational fears or phobias.\n\nOften there is a generous but short-sighted and resentful sympathy with the oppressed, and extremist and visionary tendencies may develop. Robespierre had these planets conjoined, and in square to the Sun. The conjunction occurs also in Lenin&apos;s map.\n\nThere may be a vindictive, bullying, unscrupulous disposition, and cunning methods of business, such as those of the &ldquo;bucket-shop&rdquo; fraudulent brokerage operation.\n\nIn regard to the external life, the native, though himself honorable and clean-living, may be brought into contact with the objectionable sides of life&mdash;indeed, it is certain that this will be the case. For example, unscrupulous moneylenders, cheats, share-pushers, persons addicted to sexual irregularities, drug-takers or vendors, coarse-minded and foul-mouthed persons, bullies, dishonest bankrupts, courtesans, drunkards, and so forth. He should avoid such elements most strictly or he may learn that one does not touch pitch without defilement. His kindness and charity may be imposed upon.\n\nThe most necessary desiderata for the native are to find adequate and useful outlets for the imagination, and to learn to let reason control this faculty, not only in some things but in all, for often the native is not so much generally uncontrolled in his imagination, as he is perfectly level-headed on nearly all matters, yet is liable to lose his balance in respect of some.\n\nThe effect on the health is through worry, diseases of the imagination, or through poisons or bad water. I believe there is some peril to be apprehended from animals, and from treacherous and brutal human beings. Neither of these dangers will be great unless other serious positions concur.','Charles E.O. Carter',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Thus we find enthusiasm for sport, travel, hunting, the stage, religion, political freedom, and science, though as regards the last, it is what may be called the &ldquo;live&rdquo; sciences which attract, such as psychology and astrology.\n\nThe inharmonious aspects commonly signify lack of true temperance, even if, paradoxically, it is in his austerity that the native is intemperate. It does not favor the &ldquo;middle path.&rdquo; One may cite the ascetic Gandhi.\n\nDiscontent and resentment sometimes appear, and there may be an inclination to give little and demand much; there may be extremist tendencies in politics.\n\nSometimes there may be inordinate avarice and sometimes equally inordinate extravagance. It can in fact be a most fatal aspect, leading to sheer catastrophe. Of all planetary contacts these are in the writer&apos;s opinion the worst, and this is most true of the opposition.\n\nIt occurs in the horoscopes of several writers of note, and it has also a proclivity towards music and religion, these being channels through which its emotionalism and restless excitability can be discharged. The imaginary persons of fiction, their adventures and their romances, help to satisfy its cravings for these things.\n\nThere is the ability to work hard, but in a temperamental manner, as and when the mood suits.\n\nLike the good aspects, the inharmonious ones often seem to give comfortable conditions and thus are in this sense to a certain extent fortunate; but good fortune may be abused and lost, and there is a constant tendency to waste and prodigality. Or there may be incompetence, muddle, carelessness, or treachery, the influence having points in common with Mars-Neptune, except that the circumstances of operation are generally less subtle and more usual. Thus it is easier to guard against; the native is his own enemy, and he may benefit considerably, if he will, by learning the lesson of his horoscope and taking needful precautions. He ought to avoid speculations of all kinds, but particularly those of a Jovian character, such as are connected with shipping, exploration, horses, the stage, films, the boot-trade, moneylending, drugs, and liquor. It must be recollected that Jupiter, on its negative side, rules much the same things as Neptune.\n\nThe effects on the health are likely to be through over-strain, over-excitement, over-enthusiasm, and so forth; these people are commonly poor resters. Again, they may easily lack moderation in pleasure and food.','Charles E.O. Carter',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Again, the severity may be turned inward and there may be an inner austerity and self-discipline.\n\nIts chief effect on character appears to be of a quite different kind. The Saturnian influence acts as a brake on the Martian energies, and I have certainly often noticed a sort of erraticity in these people, so that their enthusiasms are sudden and violent, but short-lasting, with alternations of &ldquo;blowing hot&rdquo; and &ldquo;blowing cold.&rdquo; Sometimes there are spells of laziness, due to the inhibition of the Mars action; sometimes there is a restless energy without good directing common sense when Mars overcomes Saturn. Definite purpose often seems lacking, as if the native regarded life as something of a child&apos;s game, passing from one interest to another lightly and inconsequentially. However much in earnest such people are (and often they seem very much so), I have noticed that they commonly forget their pursuits as soon as they cease to amuse them. True depth is generally deficient. In one case there was great love of starting fresh enterprises and considerable ability in this way; but the native soon lost interest in them when the initial difficulties had been surmounted, and left them to another : here Mars was also square Uranus.\n\nThere is usually a certain amount of selfishness or egoism. Thus, even when there is real kindness of heart, the native likes to go his own way, and will not readily turn aside from what interests him personally in order to minister to others. There is an inclination to impatience with those who do not readily agree.\n\nExteriorly Mars-Saturn tends to a life of hardship and suffering, as well as to the undergoing of physical violence.\n\nThe former may occur in the way of health. There is a danger of strain and excess; and this may be followed by the need for prolonged rest, rigid attention to dietetic and other restrictions, and otherwise &ldquo;paying the price.&rdquo;\n\nIt seems to have a distinct affinity with enteric fever.\n\nThere is also a liability to burns and scaldings.\n\nThe square is not uncommon in the horoscopes of victims of murder, as for instance King Umberto I, five-year-old strangling victim Willie Starchfield, and Savonarola. In all such cases other potent factors will occur in addition, for the bad aspect of two planets (as apart from Sun, Moon, and Angles) cannot, however serious, destroy the life prematurely or violently.\n\nGeneral Charles Gordon had the two planets in trine, but Mars was debilitated by sign, in Taurus in the 2nd house. The same occurs in the case of Alexander II of Russia (killed by bomb), with Mars in Cancer in the 12th.\n\nIt does not by any means forbid success, though this will come late and after severe struggles.\n\nThese planets in combination nearly always add to the energy, although, as stated, there may be great fitfulness of activity, and, in inharmonious cases, a lack of tact and common-sense in dealing with others.\n\nMars-Saturn seems connected with fire in a wide sense, for Warren Leland, who lost wife and daughter in a great fire and died of shock in consequence, had them in conjunction. Also Dr. Alfred Russell Wallace, who lost his scientific collections by fire, had them in square. In another case communicated to me privately an officer with this aspect was recommended for the D.S.O., but never received this decoration because the papers were destroyed by fire and the recommending officer was killed at the same time.','Charles E.O.

They are valuable, and yet, unless the planets are well placed by sign and have no other aspects of a discordant kind, they may be somewhat critical, even when they are technically of a benefic nature.\n\nThey greatly add to the energy, vigor, decision, and will-power of the native, who is very rarely of a milk-and-water or nondescript character. He will as a rule know his own mind excellently well, and much will depend on the rest of the map, for, unless this shows sense and judgment, the strength of Mars-Uranus may lead to disaster because of its very strength and courage.\n\nWith the inharmonious aspects we get a good deal of self-will and eccentricity. There is no lack of energy, but it is often fitful and ill-directed, and the native is often a relative failure, being unable for some reason to make as good use of his talents as might reasonably be expected. Ill-temper is common, but is not always present; sometimes there is a tendency rather to fretfulness and erratic self-will; the native may be blunt and abrupt, or irritable and querulous. Sometimes the nervous conditions lead to shyness and retirement. The native is often what is known as edgy or ornery, and is frequently not well-fitted for ordinary existence; it is distinctly unfavorable for married life or for any restricted or ordered way of living, but it is not an aspect which as a rule indicates any essential ill-nature or vice.\n\nLike all combinations which create a desire for freedom and unrestriction, this often externalizes in the shape of suicidal tendencies, the native being unfitted to brook patiently the checks and delays that occur in most walks of life. Patience is a virtue that is seldom present, and humility is also rare. The native is likely to scorn diplomacy and any kind of maneuvering, and is prone to throw up the sponge as soon as this is called for. In a word, he wants his own way at all costs.\n\nAs we have mentioned before, there are often attacks on the native&apos;s morals or honor, and sometimes there are direct assaults on his person, provided other more vital points are afflicted as well.\n\nAccidents are not infrequent, and these aspects do not make for longevity, for there is seldom much placidity with Mars-Uranus, and the ability to acquiesce cheerfully and readily in the dispensations of Providence is not often very noticeable.\n\nThere is often a disposition to take risks, and to overwork.','Charles E.O.

These aspects do undoubtedly stimulate the imagination immensely, so that, if the mind is of a sordid character, the fancies take their hue from it, and revel in impurity, sometimes with external results of a grave kind. On the other hand, in an otherwise good natus, the influence may be harmlessly, and even usefully, discharged in some direction wherein the imagination can receive adequate scope. Hence we find this contact exceedingly common in the maps of actors and painters, singers, dancers, and others following cognate pursuits. It is also by no means rare in the maps of astrologers, because the lofty and sublime character of our art gives scope for the exalted flights of the imagination. Ordinary life is too humdrum and colorless for the Mars-Neptune native; hence he seeks pursuits that are capable of appealing to the romantic and grandeur-loving elements of the soul. That some seek a false satisfaction in the realms of the drug-taker and the sensualist does not alter the basic character of the aspect.\n\nNevertheless, high emotionalism may lead to serious conditions. The native is often slow to admit error. His abilities may fall short of his aspirations&mdash;indeed they are sure to do so; hence there may be a poignant sense of failure, often due to some inner neurotic condition rather than to an outward and tangible obstacle. The contact often breeds irrational fears or phobias.\n\nOften there is a generous but short-sighted and resentful sympathy with the oppressed, and extremist and visionary tendencies may develop. Robespierre had these planets conjoined, and in square to the Sun. The conjunction occurs also in Lenin&apos;s map.\n\nThere may be a vindictive, bullying, unscrupulous disposition, and cunning methods of business, such as those of the &ldquo;bucket-shop&rdquo; fraudulent brokerage operation.\n\nIn regard to the external life, the native, though himself honorable and clean-living, may be brought into contact with the objectionable sides of life&mdash;indeed, it is certain that this will be the case. For example, unscrupulous moneylenders, cheats, share-pushers, persons addicted to sexual irregularities, drug-takers or vendors, coarse-minded and foul-mouthed persons, bullies, dishonest bankrupts, courtesans, drunkards, and so forth. He should avoid such elements most strictly or he may learn that one does not touch pitch without defilement. His kindness and charity may be imposed upon.\n\nThe most necessary desiderata for the native are to find adequate and useful outlets for the imagination, and to learn to let reason control this faculty, not only in some things but in all, for often the native is not so much generally uncontrolled in his imagination, as he is perfectly level-headed on nearly all matters, yet is liable to lose his balance in respect of some.\n\nThe effect on the health is through worry, diseases of the imagination, or through poisons or bad water. I believe there is some peril to be apprehended from animals, and from treacherous and brutal human beings. Neither of these dangers will be great unless other serious positions concur.','Charles E.O. Carter',0,0,'en',14,0,0);

Sometimes this is directed towards the animal world, sometimes towards the slum-dweller and outcast. The lower the position and the worse the circumstances of the applicant the more willing it is to succor.

The sensitivity is very great.\n\nThe Jovian part of the combination also inclines to metaphysical speculation or psychic investigations, and thus we get many spiritists, students of New Thought, Christian Scientists, and followers of other sects of this description.\n\nLike Mars-Neptune, it inclines to make the native seek the grandiose and the seeming-impossible, but its action is milder, gentler, and more subtle. It is idealistic and may easily tend to drift away from the actual world, or to deny or ignore its importance. It is otherworldly, and its sense of values is at variance with that of the ordinary man or woman. It is often unable to develop properly in mundane conditions, and may seek the shelter of some form of retirement.\n\nWhereas Jupiter-Uranus seeks power, this influence is much more concerned with service, even of a lowly kind; in less practical maps there may be a proneness to a life of fantasy. It does not notice barriers, either between the classes, sexes, or nationalities, or between spiritual and mundane things; the whole range of the senses and the emotions is indefinitely enlarged.\n\nIt is good for receiving help from others without having directly merited it. Thus the native may himself minister to others in connection with a charitable organization, and may be successful in obtaining funds for that purpose. Or he may find that he is himself the recipient of kindnesses from friends or strangers without having rendered them any particular services; he is often benefited by a &ldquo;helping hand.&rdquo; Sometimes there is relief and happiness through religious retreat, and it is always an influence through which spiritual help and strength may come to the native abundantly.\n\nHowever, here, as in all cases, much attention must be paid to the general strength of the two planets, especially by sign. Cases occur in which, Jupiter being out of dignity, even the technically good aspects carry with them some troublesome limitation, such as nervous debility, bad eyesight, family misfortunes due to fraud or imprudence, or scandal. In the maps of women it may incline to faithlessness, indifference, or some form of &ldquo;Neptunianism.&rdquo; Among examples of technically good aspects between these bodies I find : A woman whose husband was passionately fond of the sea and was frequently in danger on the sea; another whose fiancé belonged to a family with an insane taint; another whose husband died directly after marriage; one who contracted disease owing to the husband&apos;s loose living; one whose husband was lame; and another whose husband&apos;s chief fault was incurable unpunctuality!\n\nPerhaps the effects of this configuration can best be described as anti-Saturnian&mdash;it tends to deprive the native of the virtues associated with the greater malefic, making them slack, kindly, apt to lend and borrow without regard to strict merits, Bohemian, free-and-easy, and changeful. But in the case of women it is clear that these characteristics are often exhibited through the husband, the native herself sometimes being very strict and conscientious, according to the tenor of the ascendant.\n\nAs an example of its bad effects (or at least of its failure to prevent them) see Notable Nativities, 306 (Nymphomania -&ldquo;utterly degraded moral nature&rdquo;).','Charles E.O.
